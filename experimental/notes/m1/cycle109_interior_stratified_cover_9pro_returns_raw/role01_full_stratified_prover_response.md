BANKABLE_LEMMA

1. Executive verdict and confidence

The full Cycle109 theorem is not proved. The first unresolved substantive implication is already in the LOW branch, before BALANCED, HIGH, or the final q-ledger can be closed:

AP
corr
	​

+uncharged degree t<σ⟹polynomially many projected residual slopes.
	​

What can be proved exactly is:

LOW slopes inject into a lifted-code residual list.

Distinct LOW slopes admit exact supports forming a strong packing.

Genuine syndrome-pencil containment is automatically a contained charge; the remaining Gate B issue is only bounded-degree pseudo-containment, not actual linear containment.

Under a decorated separator cover, the exact same-field numerator ledger is

N
off
	​

≤B
paid
	​

+
c
∑

The final 2

c
∑
	​

d

⌋.

Confidence: high on the proved lemma and the failure location; moderate-high that LOW is the first branch in the intended Cycle109 ordering. This is official-prize-relevant reduction progress, but not a prize proof and not a counterpacket.

The public source likewise treats the exact residue-line normal form as proved while leaving the all-line positive packing bound conjectural.

2. Exact theorem statement
Theorem: LOW projection, support packing, and true-containment charge

Let

K=K
line
	​

,∣K∣=q
line
	​

,

let D⊂K consist of n distinct points, and let

C=RS[K,D,k].

Fix an integer σ≥1, put

a=k+σ≤n,

and let 1≤t≤σ. Consider a residue-line datum

(E,N,w)

with

E,N∈K[X],degE=t,E(x)

=0 ∀x∈D,
0

=N,degN<t,w:D→K.

Define its slope set

Z
t
	​

(E,N,w):=
⎩
⎨
⎧
	​

z∈K:
∃Q∈K[X], degQ<k+t,
∣{x∈D:Q(x)=w(x)}∣≥a,
Q≡zN(modE)
	​

⎭
⎬
⎫
	​

.

Then:

A. Exact LOW residual-list injection

Let

L
t,σ
	​

(w)={Q∈K[X]:degQ<k+t, ∣{x∈D:Q(x)=w(x)}∣≥k+σ}.

There is an injection

Z
t
	​

(E,N,w)↪L
t,σ
	​

(w),

and hence

∣Z
t
	​

(E,N,w)∣≤∣L
t,σ
	​

(w)∣.
	​

Equivalently, LOW degree t<σ is an ordinary list problem for the lifted code

RS[K,D,k+t]

at residual slack

(k+σ)−(k+t)=σ−t.

This is the public source’s exact residual-slack reduction.

B. Exact support-packing cap

For every z∈Z
t
	​

(E,N,w), one may choose a witness Q
z
	​

 and an exact support

S
z
	​

⊂D,∣S
z
	​

∣=a,Q
z
	​

∣
S
z
	​

	​

S
z
	​

	​

.

For distinct slopes z

=z
′
,

∣S
z
	​

∩S
z
′
	​

∣≤k+t−1.
	​

Consequently,

∣Z
t
	​

(E,N,w)∣≤
(
k+t
k+σ
	​

)
(
k+t
n
	​

)
	​

.
	​

(2.1)

This cap is exact and branch-degree-aware, but it is generally exponential and therefore does not prove the required n
C
 bound.

C. Fixed-support syndrome-pencil trichotomy

Let H be a parity-check matrix for C. For words f,g:D→K, write

α=Hf,β=Hg.

For S⊂D, put T=D∖S and

V
T
	​

=span
K
	​

{H
x
	​

:x∈T}.

Then

f+zg agrees with a codeword on S⟺α+zβ∈V
T
	​

.

For a fixed support S, precisely one of the following occurs:

Condition
β∈
/
V
T
	​

β∈V
T
	​

, α∈

V
T
	​

α,β∈V
T
	​

	​

Number of slopes
≤1
0
q
line
	​

	​

	​

In the last case, both f and g are individually explained on S, so the support is contained and contributes zero to the official noncontained bad-slope numerator.

Thus:

Geometric containment of the syndrome pencil in one support plane⟹official contained charge.
	​

(2.2)

The fixed-support “at most one slope” statement is equivalent to the top-interpolation-coefficient criterion Π
S
	​

(f)+zΠ
S
	​

(g)=0.

D. Decorated separator ledger

Suppose all remaining uncharged slopes have a disjoint tagged cover

Z
unc
	​

⊆
c∈C
⨆
	​

Z
c
	​

,

where every chart tag c retains all support-dependent normalization data. Assume:

there is an injective same-field normalization

ν
c
	​

:Z
c
	​

↪K;

the normalized chart is a line L
c
	​

(θ);

there is a polynomial F
c
	​

 of degree d
c
	​

 that vanishes on the chart’s admissible image but for which

F
c
	​

(L
c
	​

(θ))

≡0.

Then

∣Z
c
	​

∣≤d
c

,

and therefore

N

≤B

3. Proof and full branch audit
3.1 Proof of the residual-list injection

For each z∈Z
t
	​

, choose a witness Q
z
	​

.

Suppose the same polynomial Q witnessed two slopes z

=z
′
. Then

Q≡zN(modE),Q≡z
′
N(modE),

so

(z−z
′
)N≡0(modE).

Since z−z
′

=0, this implies E∣N. But

0

=N,degN<degE,

which is impossible. Hence z↦Q
z
	​

 is injective.

This proves part A.

The critical point is the residual slack:

σ
residual
	​

=σ−t.

The original corrected reserve at slack σ does not automatically apply to the lifted code at slack σ−t. At t=σ−1, this becomes a slack-one list problem. Therefore a raw invocation of the original reserve is invalid.

3.2 Proof of support separation

Shrink every witness agreement set to exactly a=k+σ points and denote it by S
z
	​

.

Suppose

∣S
z
	​

∩S
z
′
	​

∣≥k+t.

On the intersection,

Q
z
	​

=w=Q
z
′
	​

.

Thus Q
z
	​

−Q
z
′
	​

 has at least k+t roots, while

deg(Q
z
	​

−Q
z
′
	​

)<k+t.

Therefore Q
z
	​

=Q
z
′
	​

. The residue congruences then force z=z
′
, contradiction.

Hence

∣S
z
	​

∩S
z
′
	​

∣≤k+t−1.

Every S
z
	​

 contains (
k+t
k+σ
	​

) subsets of size k+t. No such subset can occur in two different S
z
	​

. Since D has only (
k+t
n
	​

) such subsets,

∣Z
t
	​

∣(
k+t
k+σ
	​

)≤(
k+t
n
	​

),

proving (2.1).

This cannot close Cycle109. For example, at t=σ−1,

∣Z
t
	​

∣≤
k+σ
(
k+σ−1
n
	​

)
	​

,

which is exponential in n when (k+σ)/n stays in a nontrivial constant-density interval.

3.3 Proof of the syndrome trichotomy

A word u agrees with a codeword on S iff there is an error word e, supported on T=D∖S, such that

u−e∈C.

Applying H,

Hu=He∈V
T
	​

.

For u=f+zg, this becomes

α+zβ∈V
T
	​

.

Passing to the quotient syndrome space K
n−k
/V
T
	​

, one solves

α
ˉ
+z
β
ˉ
	​

=0.

If
β
ˉ
	​


=0, there is at most one solution. If
β
ˉ
	​

=0 but
α
ˉ

=0, there is none. If both vanish, every slope is a solution, but f and g are separately code-explained on S, which is exactly the contained case.

This proves (2.2).

It also sharpens the Cycle106–108 Gate B wall:

Gate B is not needed to rule out actual containment in a support plane. Actual containment is already an official contained charge. Gate B is needed to rule out the weaker phenomenon that the normalized line is contained in a bounded-degree algebraic closure or moment closure of the support image without being contained in any genuine support plane.

That is the exact rank-escape distinction.

3.4 BALANCED branch

At t=σ, the witness degree bound is

degQ<k+σ=a.

For every a-support S, the anchor has a unique interpolant Q
S
w
	​

. Hence

Z
σ
	​

(E,N,w)⟷{[Q
S
w
	​

]
E
	​

:∣S∣=a}∩K[N]
E
	​

.

This is the exact balanced residue-cloud formulation.

However, arbitrary anchors can split supports having the same undecorated locator residue into distinct prescribed slopes. In particular, supports with a common core of size k and disjoint σ-point petals give

∣Z
σ
	​

∣≥min{q
line
	​

,⌊
σ
n−k
	​

⌋}.

The source proves this construction explicitly.

Consequences:

a monic-anchor locator by itself is not a valid balanced chart;

the chart must retain the anchor residue or equivalent Möbius-jet/syndrome-pencil decoration;

this floor is only O(logn) when σ≳n/logn, so it is not a source-valid counterpacket to the repaired theorem;

no polynomial upper cover is currently proved.

3.5 HIGH branch

Put

t=σ+h,h>0.

For a fixed support S of size a=k+σ, the affine space of degree-<k+t polynomials agreeing with w on S has dimension

(k+t)−a=h.

Thus the support no longer determines Q; the residue-line condition becomes an intersection of an h-dimensional affine family with the slope line in K[X]/(E).

Cycle108’s transverse affine-plane normal form correctly captures this. But a naive choice of h extra interpolation points creates

(
h
n−a
	​

)

support-dependent charts. Its exponent depends on h, violating the required bound n
C
 with C independent of branch degree.

Therefore the precise HIGH wall is:

compress the h-dimensional transverse selector into n
O(1)
 decorated charts, uniformly in h.
	​

No such compression theorem is in the packet.

3.6 Branch-by-branch cap ledger
Branch	Exact currently justified distinct-slope cap
Endpoint	1
Quotient/periodic	No official all-line upper cap proved; trivial cap q
line
	​

 is useless
Genuinely contained on the active support	0 in the noncontained numerator
Delete-one degeneration	Not capped in the packet
Tangent	No source-valid upper cap supplied
Field confinement to B⊂K
line
	​

	(
c affine B-colors/cosets	At most (c
LOW t<σ	Exact cap (2.1), generally exponential
BALANCED t=σ	Exact residue-cloud description; no polynomial cap
HIGH t>σ	Transverse affine-plane description; no uniform chart count
Same-slope support collisions	Zero additional numerator
Support-dependent normalization	Valid only when its chart tag is retained
Internal/normalization charge	Cannot be capped until its exact source predicate is specified

This is why the full partition does not yet produce a numerator theorem.

4. Verification requirements

A source-valid Cycle109 checker must consume the following certificates.

A. Field ledger

For every object, record its field:

K
gen
	​

,K
code
	​

,K
line
	​

,K
chal
	​

.

It must verify:

every counted slope lies in K
line
	​

;

every normalization coefficient lies in K
line
	​

;

the normalization has nonzero linear coefficient;

a support-dependent normalization retains its chart tag;

q
gen
	​

 is used only for reserve/list entropy;

q
chal
	​

 replaces q
line
	​

 only after a proved protocol-transfer theorem.

B. Witness checker

For every slope certificate (z,E,N,w,Q,S), check exactly:

z∈K
line
	​

,∣S∣≥k+σ,degQ<k+degE,
E(x)

=0(x∈D),Q∣
S
	​

=w∣
S
	​

,Q−zN≡0(modE).
C. Charge checker

Every paid slope must carry one of:

endpoint certificate;

quotient pullback/periodicity certificate;

actual contained-support syndrome certificate;

delete-one certificate;

tangent certificate;

subfield-confinement certificate;

affine-color certificate;

explicitly specified normalization/internal-charge certificate.

A verbal declaration that a branch is “structured” is not a certificate.

D. Chart checker

Each chart must output:

c,ν
c
	​

(z),L
c
	​

(θ),F
c
	​

,d
c
	​

.

The checker verifies:

ν
c
	​

 injective,
F
c
	​

∣
admissible chart image
	​

=0,
F
c
	​

(L


≡0,
deg
θ
	​

F
c
	​

(L
c
	​

(θ))≤d
c
	​

.

A Gate B failure must output a named official charge; otherwise the theorem stops.

E. Integer numerator checker

The final line must literally calculate

B
paid
	​

+
c
∑
	​

d
c
	​

and compare it with

⌊
2
128
q

	​

	​

⌋.

A statement N
off
	​

=n
O(1)
 is insufficient. The official challenge targets error 2
−128
 and describes the field as sufficiently large, so the proof must state the actual lower field-size threshold produced by its numerator.

5. Next exact lemma or construction
Exact first missing lemma
L-CYCLE110-LOW-INTRINSIC-PROJECTED-IMAGE-OR-CHARGE
	​

Let (E,N,w) be an official, intrinsically reduced LOW residue datum over K
line
	​

, with

1≤t<σ,

satisfying the corrected reserve and the official source predicate AP
corr
	​

. Remove, in the prescribed branch order, endpoint, quotient/periodic, contained/delete-one, tangent, field-confinement, affine-color, and named normalization charges.

Then prove one of the following:

Projected-image bound: there is an absolute constant C
L
	​

, independent of k,σ,t, such that

∣Z
t
	​

(E,N,w)∣≤n
C
L
	​

;

more strongly, exhibit at most n
A
L
	​

 decorated charts with separators of degree at most n
B
L
	​

, where

C
L
	​

=A
L
	​

+B
L
	​

;

Official charge: every failure of such a separator produces a mechanically verifiable charge from the official list.

The essential missing implication is not an ordinary lifted-code list bound. It is:

AP
corr
	​

+intrinsic denominator minimality+absence of charges⟹bounded projected residue image.

A counterpacket would have to give a growing family with:

t<σ,σ above corrected reserve,

all official charges absent, and

∣Z
t
	​

(E,N,w)∣>n
C

for every fixed C, or at least exceeding the exact targeted numerator budget. A finite balanced residue-cloud example, a model-field example, or a large list with many identical slope residues is not such a counterpacket.

2. Is this official-prize-relevant?

It is an official-prize-relevant structural reduction because it uses the actual line field and official residue-line/noncontainment objects. It is not a prize certificate, finite certificate, or counterpacket.

3. What is the first line where the theorem could fail?

Even granting the repaired AP
corr
	​

 predicate, the first line is:

uncharged LOW residual list⟹polynomial projected slope image.
	​

The original reserve cannot simply be reused because the residual slack is σ−t.

4. Are the fields and 2

 target used correctly?

Yes:

q
gen

: reserve and entropy only;

q
code
	​

: source alphabet/code realization;

q

	​

: distinct-slope count and probability denominator;

q

: unusable as denominator without transfer;

target:

	​

No field substitution has been made.

5. Could the named structures reduce the numerator?

Yes.

Quotient/periodic slopes must be removed before the aperiodic residual count.

Actual contained supports contribute zero.

Delete-one and tangent terms may reduce the residual set but presently lack caps.

Same-slope collisions contribute only one numerator unit.

Endpoint contributes at most one.

Field confinement caps a branch by the subfield size.

Affine color normalization caps a certified union of c colors by c∣B∣.

Support-dependent normalization may reduce each chart’s image, but only if the chart tag is retained.

The packing cap (2.1) is therefore an upper bound before all these possible reductions; it is not claimed to equal N

	​

.

6. What would convert this into PROOF or COUNTERPACKET?

PROOF: prove the LOW lemma above, then analogous explicit BALANCED and HIGH decorated covers, prove AP
corr
	​

⇒ separator-or-charge on every chart, supply exact caps for every paid branch, and verify the integer q
line
	​

-ledger.

COUNTERPACKET: construct a growing official family over the actual line field, above corrected reserve, with every official charge explicitly ruled out and with superpolynomial—or numerically excessive—distinct slopes.
