COUNTERPACKET
1. Executive verdict and confidence
L-CYCLE111-LOW-T1-OCCUPANCY-UPPER is false as stated, even in the same-field monic-anchor family.

The obstruction is not a 
q

​

​
  transfer defect. One can choose 
D
D so that a prescribed elementary-symmetric prefix fiber contains several supports while 
q
g

q

​
  is arbitrarily large. The resulting occupied colors remain nonempty—or numerous—whereas

Confidence: high on the counterexample and q-ledger arithmetic. The packet still lacks a canonical frozen AP_corr; relative to Role 05’s explicit scaffold, the construction can be chosen to pass. Therefore this is a source-route COUNTERPACKET, but official-prize promotion still requires the canonical AP_corr replay receipt.

For every proposed absolute constant

so the same-field

3. Detailed obstruction and corrected q-ledger

The basic obstruction is block pasting.

For arbitrary 
k
,
σ
k,σ, let 
a
=
k
+
σ
a=k+σ. Partition part of 
D
D into disjoint 
a
a-sets

S

and choose polynomials 
Q
i
Q

​
  of degree at most 
k
k with pairwise distinct 
Q

Q

​
 (β). Define

S
i
.
w∣ 
S 
i
​
 
​
 =Q

​
 ∣ 
S 
i
​
 
​
 .
Then

N
1
(
w
,
β
)
≥
m
.
N 
1
​
 (w,β)≥m.
For fixed 
D
,
w
D,w, this lower bound is independent of the ambient prime-field size, while

(

​
 )
​
 ⟶0
as 
q
g
e
n
→

q

​
 →∞.

Thus any valid arbitrary-word theorem requires at least one of:

an additive packing/pasting term;

an upper calibration on 
q
g
e
n
q 
gen
​
 , not merely a reserve lower bound;

a source hypothesis excluding pasted agreement blocks;

a new paid PREFIX_DESIGN or BLOCK_PASTING charge.

At

k=0, the obstruction is exact:

​
 (w,β)=#{c∈K

​
 :∣{x:w(x)=c}∣≥σ}≤⌊

and equality is attained by assigning a distinct color to each 
σ
σ-block.

L-CYCLE112-PREFIX-DESIGN-CHARGE-OR-ADDITIVE-FLOOR.

For t=1, either:

(1) the datum has a source-visible PREFIX_DESIGN/BLOCK_PASTING charge,
    consisting of a matching of agreement supports sharing the required
    elementary-symmetric prefix and carrying distinct beta-products; or

(2) one proves
    N_1 <= ceil(C0 * binom(n,k+sigma)/q_gen^(sigma-1)) + A0,

with A0 explicitly bounded and paid by
    2^128 * A0 <= the allocated q_line reserve.

 -denominated caps. Not proved: that the unpublished canonical source predicate AP_corr accepts the packet, because that predicate is not frozen in the supplied files.

Relevance.
This is a source-route counterpacket and q-ledger theorem. It is stronger than a finite/model observation. It is not yet an official-prize counterpacket solely because the packet provides neither the canonical AP_corr evaluator nor the full official corrected-reserve predicate.

Could listed structures reduce the numerator?
Quotient/action rank is vacuous at

t=1. Contained and tangent are absent. The two displayed colors are distinct, so same-slope collisions do not help. Prime-field choice removes field confinement. Fixed affine normalization preserves cardinality. Endpoint can remove at most one slope and scalable versions leave arbitrarily many. The only plausible repair is a new retained-tag prefix-design/block-pasting charge or an additive reserve paying its cap.

Conversion to official COUNTERPACKET or repaired PROOF.
Official COUNTERPACKET: freeze AP_corr, replay it on the construction, and confirm that the official corrected reserve lacks an additive condition paying the prefix-design count.
Repaired PROOF: add PREFIX_DESIGN_CHARGE or an explicit additive
