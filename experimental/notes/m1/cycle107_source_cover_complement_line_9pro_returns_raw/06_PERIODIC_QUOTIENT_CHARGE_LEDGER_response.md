BANKABLE_LEMMA

Verdict

There is a route to a full upper-side solve, but Gate A needs a tagged, polynomial-size, distinct-slope cover, not merely the assertion that each bad slope has some normalization.

The exact unresolved multiplier is the number of distinct normalization objects (
U
,chart) produced from one official syndrome line. Gate B bounds each object by D; without a polynomial bound on the number of objects, it does not bound the official numerator.

Confidence: high for the charge ledger and the algebra below; unknown for the missing source-cover and Gate B implications.

1. Tagged-cover numerator lemma

Fix an official affine syndrome line

ℓ(z)=u+zv

and let

B
ℓ
	​

=Bad
≤j
	​

(u,v)

be its set of distinct bad slopes. Thus z∈B
ℓ
	​

 only when there is some support T satisfying

u+zv∈V
T
	​

,v∈
/
V
T
	​

.

The second condition is transversality/noncontainment; the numerator is ∣B
ℓ
	​

∣, not a count of supports or representations.

ROLE_06_FRONTIER_CHECKER_LEDGER

Suppose the residual slopes are covered by normalization objects indexed by a finite set C
ℓ
	​

. An object

c=(
U
c
	​

,ψ
c
	​

,mode
c
	​

)

must have:

one fixed
U
c
	​

, independent of the chosen slope and witness inside that object;

an injective parameter map

ψ
c
	​

(z)=a
c
	​

z+b
c
	​

,a
c
	​


=0,

or another explicitly certified injection;

the appropriate ordinary or endpoint-corrected activity equation;

a deterministic assignment of each residual z to exactly one c.

Write B
ℓ,c
	​

 for the slopes assigned to c, and

Θ
ℓ,c
	​

={ψ
c
	​

(z):z∈B
ℓ,c
	​

}.

Then

∣B
ℓ,c
	​

∣=∣Θ
ℓ,c
	​

∣,

and therefore

∣B
ℓ,res
	​

∣=
c∈C
ℓ
	​

∑
	​

∣Θ
ℓ,c
	​

∣.
	​

(1)

The proof is just injectivity within each tagged chart. The tags are essential: the untagged union

	​

c
⋃
	​

Θ
ℓ,c
	​

	​


can be arbitrarily smaller than the sum.

Consequently, if Gate B proves

∣Θ
ℓ,c
	​

∣≤D

for every AP
corr
	​

 object, then

∣B
ℓ,res
	​

∣≤∣C
ℓ
	​

∣D.
	​

(2)

Thus Gate A must prove either:

a single source-global normalization object, or

a cover bound

∣C
ℓ
	​

∣≤n
C
0
	​


with C
0
	​

 independent of s,k.

A slope-by-slope construction with one
U
z
	​

 per bad slope is useless: every object might satisfy a degree-one Gate B bound while the original line has arbitrarily many bad slopes.

Directionality

For the upper route, Gate A needs an injection

B
ℓ,res
	​

↪
c∈C
ℓ
	​

⨆
	​

Θ(
U
c
	​

).

For a counterpacket transfer, the reverse injection is needed: each model-active θ must give a distinct official bad slope.

To claim that the active θ's equal the official numerator, Gate A must prove a bijection, not merely one of these injections.

2. Exact periodic-orbit lemma

Let

g
S
	​

(X)=
x∈S
∏
	​

(1−xX),

and consider the ordinary activity equation

U
(X)≡(1−θX)g
S
	​

(X)(modX
r
).
(3)

Define the dilation stabilizer

K
U
	​

={a∈H:
U
(aX)≡
U
(X)(modX
r
)}.
Lemma

If a∈K
U
	​

 and (θ,S) is active, then

(aθ,aS)

is active for the same
U
.

Indeed,

U
(X)=
U
(aX)≡(1−aθX)g
aS
	​

(X)(modX
r
).

The identical proof applies to the complement form

U
(X)≡(1−θX)g
T
	​

(X)
−1
(modX
r
).

Hence the active set is K
U
	​

-invariant:

K
U
	​

Θ(
U
)=Θ(
U
).

For θ

=0, the orbit has exactly ∣K
U
	​

∣ distinct values. Moreover, multiplication by a∈H preserves whether θ lies in H or outside H. Therefore a nontrivial
U
-stabilizer can create genuinely distinct external active parameters.

The exact periodic charge is

∣Θ(
U
)∣=1
{0∈Θ}
	​

+∣K
U
	​

∣
	​

Θ(
U
)
×
/K
U
	​

	​

.
(4)

Conclusion: nontrivial
U
-periodicity must either be forbidden by AP
corr
	​

 or charged as distinct orbit mass. It is not witness multiplicity.

3. Whole-coset swaps are different

Suppose two witnesses S,T differ, after cancelling their intersection, by unions of complete cosets of a subgroup K<H, ∣K∣=M. For a coset yK,

x∈yK
∏
	​

(1−xX)=1−y
M
X
M
.

Thus the residual locators have zero X-coefficient.

The common-
U
 equation

(1−θX)g
S∖T
	​

≡(1−ϕX)g
T∖S
	​

(modX
r
)

then gives, from the coefficient of X,

θ=ϕ.

Therefore:

literal whole-coset swaps add zero new numerator values.
	​


They can produce many witnesses, but only for the same slope. This banked Cycle106 distinction must not be conflated with the periodic-orbit lemma above.

cycle106_role07_bankable_lemma

So AP
corr
	​

 does not need to forbid every whole-coset support swap merely to control the distinct numerator. It does need to forbid or charge structures that produce distinct parameter orbits.

4. Quotient structure: the necessary distinction

There are three different phenomena.

A. Literal whole-coset witness swaps

These force the same θ. Charge: zero additional numerator.

B. Dilation-periodic
U

These create complete K
U
	​

-orbits of distinct nonzero θ's. They must be excluded or charged by (4).

C. Hidden source-side quotient components

A source denominator can have low quotient-action rank

d
M
	​

(E)=deg\minpoly([X
M
]modE)<degE

without being a literal polynomial E
0
	​

(X
M
). Source-valid punctured-fiber packets show that such hidden components can have an injective support-to-slope map, so their mass can be mass of distinct slopes rather than witness multiplicity.

04_quotient_component_counterpa…

Therefore the test

E

=E
0
	​

(X
M
)

or “no literal whole-coset swap” is too weak.

The Gate A alternatives are exact:

prove that AP
corr
	​

(
U
) contains a source-valid component-aperiodicity condition equivalent to

d
M
	​

(E)=degEfor every active quotient scale M,

together with a proof that this condition transfers to the
U
 object; or

place every low-action-rank slope into a separate quotient branch and give a distinct-slope cap Q
ℓ
	​

.

The old quotient-component packet is a source-valid counterexample to a weak literal-pullback classifier. It is not presently a counterpacket to the eventual AP
corr
	​

, because that predicate has not been defined.

5. Contained incidence charge

The official numerator already excludes a support T for which

v∈V
T
	​

.

But the quantifiers matter:

If every representation of z is contained, z∈
/
B
ℓ
	​

.

If z has one contained representation and another transverse representation, z∈B
ℓ
	​

 and counts once.

Therefore a slope cannot be deleted merely because one contained witness exists.

A Gate A checker must select a transverse witness for every recorded official bad slope.

The Cycle106 close-collision classification is a different fact. When two distinct-θ witnesses exchange at most σ points, they form the internal delete-one packet

R⊂H,∣R∣=s+1,S
θ
	​

=R∖{θ},θ∈R,

which contributes at most

s+1≤n

values.

cycle106_role07_bankable_lemma

That packet must not be declared “officially contained” without a Gate A proof. Until such a proof exists, the valid charge is

C
del
	​

≤n,

not zero.

6. Same-slope collisions

The official count is the projection onto z:

∣{z:∃ transverse witness for z}∣.

Hence:

ten supports for one z contribute one;

two quotient representations for one z contribute one;

repeated supports or coefficients contribute one.

Inside the complement-line object there is no parameter collision:

L
U
	​

(θ)
1
	​

=v
1
	​

−θv
0
	​

=v
1
	​

−θ,

since v
0
	​

=1. Thus

θ⟼L
U
	​

(θ)

is injective.

The only remaining possible collapse is in the official-to-θ normalization. A common affine map with nonzero linear part preserves cardinality exactly. A support-dependent or chart-dependent normalization does not preserve cardinality unless the chart tag is retained and the chart contributions are summed.

7. Affine color normalization

For a fixed syndrome line, a common change

χ⟼aχ+b,a

=0

is a bijection and preserves every collision class and the exact number of distinct slopes. The banked generalized-Jacobian color calculation has precisely this invariance for a global augmented-row change.

ROLE_05_T1_MCA_GJ_COLOR_RESULT

The unsafe operation is

χ
T
	​

⟼a
T
	​

χ
T
	​

+b
T
	​


with a
T
	​

,b
T
	​

 depending on the witness, support, or chart, followed by forgetting T. Such maps can send many distinct official slopes to one normalized value.

Therefore:

common affine normalization: no loss; variable normalization: tag and sum.
	​

8. Exact Cycle107 charge formula

For each official line ℓ, make a deterministic slope-level partition

B
ℓ
	​

=B
ℓ,end
	​

⊔B
ℓ,quot
	​

⊔B
ℓ,per
	​

⊔B
ℓ,del
	​

⊔B
ℓ,AP
	​

.
(5)

If predicates overlap, use a fixed priority order. Every branch count is a count of distinct z's, never witnesses.

Let:

E
ℓ
	​

=∣B
ℓ,end
	​

∣,Q
ℓ
	​

=∣B
ℓ,quot
	​

∣,P
ℓ
	​

=∣B
ℓ,per
	​

∣,C
ℓ
	​

=∣B
ℓ,del
	​

∣.

Let C
ℓ
	​

 be the tagged AP
corr
	​

 cover of the residual branch. Gate B then gives

∣B
ℓ
	​

∣≤E
ℓ
	​

+Q
ℓ
	​

+P
ℓ
	​

+C
ℓ
	​

+∣C
ℓ
	​

∣D.
	​

(6)

Therefore

M
C
	​

(σ)≤
ℓ
max
	​

(E
ℓ
	​

+Q
ℓ
	​

+P
ℓ
	​

+C
ℓ
	​

+∣C
ℓ
	​

∣D).
	​

(7)

Within one line, the branch charges are summed. Replacing the sum by a maximum is valid only if whole lines, rather than slopes within a line, have been placed in mutually exclusive cases.

The ordinary complement-line formula cannot be used when σ+1=n. That parameter regime must either use the corrected

(1−X
n
)A(X)
−1
(modX
σ+2
)

object with its own injective chart proof, or remain inside B
ℓ,end
	​

.

9. Minimum viable definition of AP
corr
	​


The charge audit does not prove that these conditions suffice for Gate B. It proves that the following are necessary for an uncharged residual object:

AP
corr
	​

(
U
)⟹
⎩
⎨
⎧
	​

Stab
H
	​

(
U
)={1},
no uncharged source quotient-action-rank defect,
not in the internal delete-one class, or that class was removed,
ordinary/endpoint mode is correctly specified,
one fixed tagged chart for the counted slope subset.
	​

(8)

It need not prohibit:

duplicate witnesses for one slope;

literal whole-coset swaps that force the same slope;

harmless global affine changes of color.

Prohibiting those may make Gate A unnecessarily false while providing no numerator benefit.

10. Exact next lemma

The required Gate A statement should be sharpened to:

L-CYCLE107-OFFICIAL-DISTINCT-SLOPE-TO-POLYNOMIAL-TAGGED-AP-COVER
Statement

For every official M1 syndrome line ℓ at corrected reserve, construct:

a transverse-witness selector for every z∈B
ℓ
	​

;

the disjoint partition (5);

explicit distinct-slope caps

E
ℓ
	​

,Q
ℓ
	​

,P
ℓ
	​

,C
ℓ
	​

≤n
O(1)
;

a tagged family

{(
U

	​

,ψ

	​

,mode

	​

):c∈C
ℓ
	​

}

satisfying

∣C
ℓ
	​

∣≤n
O(1)
;

an injective map

Θ(
U
c
	​

);

AP
corr
	​

(
U
c
	​

) for every c;

the corrected endpoint identity whenever σ+1=n.

Gate B would then imply (7), with an exponent independent of s,k.

Exact checker

A source-cover checker should have one record per distinct official z, containing:

line_id
z
canonical transverse support
official incidence certificate
transversality certificate
branch_id
endpoint_mode
chart_id
a, b, theta
Uhat coefficients
active-equation certificate
AP_corr certificate or branch-charge certificate

It must reject:

UNTAGGED_CHART_COLLISION
MULTIPLE_UHAT_OBJECTS_UNCHARGED
WITNESS_MULTIPLICITY_USED_AS_NUMERATOR
CONTAINED_WITNESS_WITHOUT_TRANSVERSE_WITNESS
HIDDEN_QUOTIENT_ACTION_RANK
PERIODIC_ORBIT_UNCHARGED
ENDPOINT_FORMULA_UNCORRECTED

A successful output must include

∣B
ℓ
	​

∣, E
ℓ
	​

, Q
ℓ
	​

, P
ℓ
	​

, C
ℓ
	​

, ∣C
ℓ
	​

∣

and verify their exact sum.

The sharp logical countermechanism is cover explosion: N bad slopes, each assigned to a separate
U
i
	​

 with one active θ
i
	​

. Gate B proves 1 for every object but gives N overall. This is not yet a source-valid counterpacket; it identifies the missing hypothesis in Gate A.

Required output

For a fixed official line, partition distinct bad slopes and use

Self-audit

1. Exact implication proved.
I proved the tagged-cover identity (1), the cover-multiplier bound (2), the periodic-orbit lemma, and the exact zero-additional-numerator rule for literal whole-coset swaps. I also proved the correct aggregation formula (6).

I did not prove the official source normalization, the polynomial cover bound, a quotient branch cap, the endpoint-corrected complement line, AP
corr
	​

⇒R
m,D
	​


=0, or the official M1 upper theorem.

2. Relevance.
This is official-route-relevant as a source-accounting lemma. It is not a prize theorem, a source-valid counterpacket, or merely a p=97 finite certificate.

3. First possible failure.
The first failure is:

official distinct bad slopes⟶polynomially many tagged, injective normalization objects.

A slope-by-slope unbounded cover is not enough. After that, the next failure is the transfer to AP
corr
	​

; after that, Gate B.

4. Field usage.
No q-arithmetic is used in the structural proof. At official transfer, q
gen
	​

, q
line
	​

, and q
code
	​

 must be separately typed. The final MCA target is controlled by q
line
	​

. q
chal
	​

 is irrelevant unless a later protocol theorem invokes it.

5. Possible numerator reductions.
Yes:

support and whole-coset multiplicity reduce to one value per slope;

contained-only incidences contribute zero, but mixed transverse/contained slopes still count;

global affine normalization preserves the numerator;

untagged variable normalization can collapse it;

hidden quotient components and periodic
U
-orbits can produce genuinely distinct slopes and cannot be divided out;

the Cycle106 internal delete-one class is at most n, but cannot be deleted as “officially contained” without Gate A.

6. Route to PROOF or COUNTERPACKET.
For PROOF, establish the polynomial tagged-cover lemma above and then Gate B for every residual object. For COUNTERPACKET, construct either:

a source-valid corrected-reserve family satisfying the eventual AP
corr
	​

 with superpolynomially many distinct external θ's; or

a source-valid official line whose bad slopes require superpolynomially many inequivalent normalization objects, refuting the proposed Gate A cover.
