COUNTERPACKET:
  prize-strength corrected reserve,
  source AP_corr true,
  t=1 intrinsic LOW,
  endpoint/field/affine-color/tangent/contained charges absent or paid,
  quotient/action-rank vacuous,
  distinct K_line slopes exceed the calibrated occupancy budget.


If you think the target is true, give a proof precise enough to enter a public
experimental ledger. If there is a missing hypothesis, state the exact missing
hypothesis. If your output is a checker plan, specify exact input, terminal
labels, replay requirements, and what implication the checker proves.

Use these labels exactly:

Read the current-state file and Cycle110 audit before answering. The Cycle110
returns are inputs, not authorities. You may disagree with them, but if you do,
identify the exact line of failure.

Required output structure:

1. Executive verdict and confidence.
2. Exact theorem, counterpacket, route cut, or checker statement.
3. Detailed proof, construction, or obstruction.
4. Verification requirements or replay requirements.
5. Next exact lemma or construction.

# Mandatory Self-Audit Addendum

Before finalizing, do a self-audit. Explicitly answer:

1. What exact implication did I prove, and what exact implication did I not
   prove?
2. Is the result official-prize-relevant, source-route-relevant, or only a
   finite/model/research certificate?
3. What is the first line in the reduction chain where the theorem could fail?
4. Are q_gen, q_line, q_code, q_chal, and the 2^-128 target being
   used correctly?
5. Could quotient/periodic structure, contained incidences, same-slope
   collisions, affine color normalization, tangent concentration, field
   confinement, hidden action rank, or retained normalization reduce the
   claimed numerator?
6. If my answer is a PLAN, what exact theorem/checker/counterpacket would
   convert it into PROOF or COUNTERPACKET?

Do not hide behind broad language. Give the exact next lemma, exact missing
hypothesis, or exact counterexample mechanism.

# Role 04: Character-Sum / Fourier Prover

Attack the t=1 occupancy wall using finite-field Fourier, character sums,
additive combinatorics, or algebraic exponential sums.

Focus points:

1. Express the elementary-symmetric-prefix fiber and product-evaluation image
   through additive/multiplicative characters.
2. Determine whether Weil/Deligne-style cancellation, sum-product estimates,
   or extractor-style arguments give the calibrated denominator.
3. Keep constants and field types explicit. Do not use q_chal as a free
   denominator.
4. If cancellation fails, identify the exact structured obstruction: subfield,
   torus, quotient, periodicity, tangent, same-slope, or affine normalization.

Ambition bar: give a source-route theorem with exact hypotheses, not a
heuristic random-model estimate.

I’ll first inspect the packet’s current-state and Cycle110 audit files, then trace the reduction to the 
t
=
1
t=1 occupancy target before trying a character-sum proof or isolating a source-valid obstruction.

The packet narrows the issue to direct control of off-domain evaluation colors at 
t
=
1
t=1, with quotient/action-rank escapes unavailable. I’m checking whether the symmetric-fiber/product formulation really covers arbitrary words and whether the field ledger hides extra hypotheses.

A concrete obstruction is emerging: both patched local RS words and monic-anchor periodic examples violate the claimed denominator, pointing to a missing aperiodicity/floor or sparse-diagonal term.

COUNTERPACKET
1. Executive verdict and confidence
The displayed theorem L-CYCLE111-LOW-T1-OCCUPANCY-UPPER is false as stated, even:

in the same field

​
 ;

under arbitrarily strong corrected reserve;

for the monic-anchor family;

after paying the single endpoint allowance;

with distinct slopes and simple, nontangent agreements.

The obstruction is a planted family of disjoint equal-prefix support atoms. Its size is polynomial in 
n
n and independent of the field size, whereas

Confidence: high.

This is a counterpacket to the literal source-route occupancy theorem, not automatically a counterexample to the final prize theorem: a separate polynomial sparse-packet term can still fit inside

3. Detailed construction and proof
For each 
i

L
i
(
X
)
=
∏
x
∈
S
i
(
X
−
x
)
.
L 
i
​
 (X)= 
x∈S 
i
​
 
∏
​
 (X−x).
Since

i
+
(
m
+
i
)
−
(
m
+
2
i
)
=
0
,
i+(m+i)−(m+2i)=0,
the 
X

 -coefficient of 
L

L

  vanishes. Directly,

L

X
)
=

+
3
i

)
X

i
(
m

)
(
m

)
.
L 
i
​
 (X)=X 
3
 −(m 
2
 +3mi+3i 
2
 )X+i(m+i)(m+2i).
Define

Q
i
(
X
)
=
M
(
X
)
−
L
i
(
X
)
.
Q 
i
​
 (X)=M(X)−L 
i
​
 (X).
Therefore

Q
i
(
X
)
=
(

+
3
i
2
)
X
−

(

i
)
,
Q 
i
​
 (X)=(m 
2
 +3mi+3i 
2
 )X−i(m+i)(m+2i),
so

deg
⁡
Q
i

degQ 
i
​
 ≤1=k.
For every 
x
∈
S
i
x∈S 
i
​
 ,

L
i
(
x
)
=
0
,
L 
i
​
 (x)=0,
and hence

Q
i
(
x
)
=
M
(
x
)
=
w
(
x
)
.
Q 
i
​
 (x)=M(x)=w(x).
Thus

At the off-domain point 
β

β=0,

Q
i
(

=

i
(
m

)
(
m

i

.
Q 
i
​
 (0)=−i(m+i)(m+2i).
The positive integers

g
i
=
i
(
m
+
i
)
(
m
+
2
i
)
g 
i
​
 =i(m+i)(m+2i)
are strictly increasing in 
i
i, and

g
i

g
m
=
6
m
3
<
p
.
g 
i
​
 ≤g 
m
​
 =6m

 <p.
Therefore their negatives modulo 
p
p are distinct, proving that the 
Q
i
(
0
)
Q 
i
​
 (0) are 
m
m distinct evaluation colors.

Monic-anchor product formulation
All 
S
i
S 
i
​
  lie in the prefix fiber

e
1
(
S
)
=
0
,
e 
1
​
 (S)=0,
because 
σ
−
1
=
1
σ−1=1. Moreover

∏
x
∈
S
i
(
β
−
x
)
=
∏
x
∈
S
i
(
−
x
)
=
i
(
m
+
i
)
(
m
+
2
i
)
,
x∈S 
i
​
 
∏
​
 (β−x)= 
x∈S 
i
​
 
∏
​
 (−x)=i(m+i)(m+2i),
again pairwise distinct.

Hence the product image on the fiber 
e
1
=
0
e 
1
​
 =0 has size at least 
m
m. The purported “equivalent” support/product bound is therefore also false.

Agreement is nontangent
The agreement polynomial is

w
−
Q
i
=
L
i
.
w−Q 
i
​
 =L 
i
​
 .
Every 
S
i
S 
i
​
  consists of distinct field elements, so 
L
i
L 
i
​
  is squarefree. At every agreement point 
x
∈
S
i
x∈S 
i
​
 ,

L
i
′
(
x
)
=
∏
y
∈
S
i
∖
{
x
}
(
x
−
y
)
≠
0.
L 
i
′
​
 (x)= 
y∈S 
i
​
 ∖{x}
∏
​
 (x−y)

=0.
Thus these are simple agreements, not tangent or higher-multiplicity incidences.

AUDIT: charge and source receipts
For the datum

E

B

E=X,B=1,β=0,
the following receipts are explicit.

 [X]/(X)≅F

1=t. No proper action-rank drop is possible.

Contained/delete-one: in the quotient normal form the free polynomial has degree

k

1
<k=1, hence is constant. A polynomial 
X
G
+

XG+1 has degree at most 
1

Tangent: absent by the squarefreeness calculation above.

Field confinement: absent because 
F
p
F

​
  has no proper subfields.

Additive subgroup confinement: absent because the additive group of a prime field has no nontrivial proper subgroups.

Multiplicative-coset confinement: 
D
D contains 
1
1 and a primitive element 
ρ
ρ. A multiplicative coset containing both must be the whole 
F
p
×
F 
p
×
​
 . Since 
p
≡
2
(
m
o
d
3
)
p≡2(mod3), cubing is a bijection, so 
w
(
D
)
w(D) also contains a primitive element.

Same-slope collisions: absent because the 
Q
i
(
0
)
Q 
i
​
 (0) are distinct.

Affine-color normalization: any fixed affine normalization is bijective and preserves the 
m
m distinct colors.

Endpoint: at most one color can be removed; the violation was stated with 
m
−
1
m−1.

Retained normalization: none is used.

Under the noncircular structural AP_corr scaffold proposed in the Cycle110 material—intrinsic denominator, full action rank, subgroup and subfield nonconfinement, and absence of the named degeneracies—the construction passes.

An official SOURCE_VALID_LOW_T1_COUNTERPACKET terminal label still requires a frozen source definition of AP_corr. The packet expressly records that this definition is missing, so assigning that official label without an added receipt would be overclaiming.

Thus Weil/Deligne cancellation or extractor estimates for the nontrivial
multiplicative characters yield a lower bound on the product-image size.
They cannot prove the requested upper bound. Strong cancellation makes the
product map more injective, which is exactly what happens in the counterpacket.

The only potentially useful character-sum input is an additive discrepancy
bound controlling the size of the prefix fiber. That bound is false without an
anti-atom hypothesis or a separately paid sparse term.

Exact Cycle110 line of failure
The first invalid step is:

“
σ
−
1
 algebraic conditions”
⟹
“every fiber has size 
O
(
(
n
a
)
/
q
σ
−
1
)
”
.
“σ−1 algebraic conditions”⟹“every fiber has size O(( 
a
n
​
 )/q 
σ−1
 )”.
Codimension predicts an average fiber size; it does not bound the maximum
fiber. The counterpacket places 
m
m isolated atoms in one prefix fiber while
the average fiber size is 
o
(
1
)
o(1).

A second line of failure is the claim that the monic-anchor formulation is
“equivalent” to the arbitrary-word theorem. Cycle110 established it only as a
special family. It is not a reduction from arbitrary words. In this case both
statements happen to be false, but for separate logical reasons.

EXACT_NEW_WALL
A correct next theorem must read approximately:

L-CYCLE111-T1-FOURIER-DISCREPANCY-OR-SPARSE-PREFIX-CHARGE.

For every intrinsic t=1 datum, either

  (a) the relevant prefix/interpolation fiber satisfies the explicit
      Fourier-prefix L1 bound, yielding
      C * binom(n,k+sigma) / q_gen^(sigma-1);

or

  (b) the datum emits a sparse-prefix/interpolation-packet certificate,
      with its distinct-color count paid separately in the q_line ledger.
The separate term is mathematically necessary. For arbitrary words it must be
at least

⌊
n
k
+
σ
⌋
,
⌊ 
k+σ
n
​
 ⌋,
because 
D
D can be partitioned into that many agreement blocks carrying
different constant polynomials.

For the monic-anchor subclass, the construction above already forces

M=X^3,
supports S_1,...,S_m,

optional AP_corr and charge receipts.

5. Next exact lemma or construction
The next useful lemma is not another Weil bound. It is:

L-CYCLE111-SPARSE-PREFIX-ATOM-DECOMPOSITION.

Given one witness support for each distinct t=1 color, partition the colors
into:

1. a bounded-matching sparse packet, paid by an explicit combinatorial cap; and
2. a residual support hypergraph satisfying a source-visible higher-order
   Fourier discrepancy condition strong enough to imply the main-term bound.
A maximal matching gives the first mechanical step: either there are many
disjoint support atoms, as in the counterpacket, or every support meets the
union of a bounded collection of supports. The latter produces a small hitting
set and should then be routed to a star/sunflower/retained-support charge or to
a higher-order Fourier estimate.

Freezing this sparse charge is necessary before further character-sum work can
be source-valid.

The same construction refutes the elementary-symmetric-prefix product-image
bound.

Not proved: that the construction violates the final official prize numerator
after every polynomial sparse charge is included.

2. Relevance level
This is a source-route counterpacket to the literal Cycle111 occupancy
theorem and a bankable correction to the LOW ledger. It is not by itself an
official-prize counterexample. Official source-validity awaits the missing
frozen AP_corr predicate.

3. First possible failure in the reduction chain
The first invalid arrow is the conversion of codimension or average fiber size
into a maximum-fiber upper bound. The second is the claimed equivalence between
the arbitrary-word theorem and the monic-anchor subclass.

1

primitive element.

Affine color normalization: cardinality-preserving.

Endpoint: one color paid.

Retained normalization: unused.

The missing reduction is a new sparse-prefix/interpolation-packet charge.

6. Conversion to official PROOF or COUNTERPACKET
This is not a PLAN; the falsity proof is complete.

To convert the construction to the official terminal
SOURCE_VALID_LOW_T1_COUNTERPACKET, freeze the source AP_corr predicate and
replay it on the datum.

To convert the LOW route to PROOF, replace the false theorem by the
Fourier-discrepancy-or-sparse-charge theorem, prove the residual Fourier bound,
and separately verify both integer ledger inequalities against
