AUDIT

Terminal decision: SOURCE_RECEIPT_MISSING_NO_CLAIM.

The packet does not contain an official endpoint map, final retained-color map, retained-tag equivalence, or exhaustive charge registry. Therefore neither COLOR_COMPRESSED_OR_CHARGED nor SOURCE_VALID_LOW_T1_COUNTERPACKET is justified.

The model-level P190 count is nevertheless substantially stronger than recorded: the 190 displayed colors are only a subfamily. The complete natural LOW color map has 26,245 distinct colors, hence at least 26,244 after any one-color endpoint deletion.

Exact model color map

For intrinsic t=1, E=X−β, and B(β)

=0, the banked LOW color coordinate is

c(Q)=
B(β)
Q(β)
	​

∈K
line
	​

,

up to a fixed affine bijection arising from the choice of base witness. Same-slope deduplication is equality of this value.

For P190,

β=0,E=X,B=1,

so

c(Q)=Q(0).

The domain, using small signed representatives in F
p
	​

, is

D={1,…,380}∪{−192,−194,…,−570}∪{279936}.

Let Q(X)=aX+b agree with w(X)=X
3
 on at least three points of D. Then

X
3
−Q(X)=X
3
−aX−b

has exactly three distinct roots x,y,z∈D. Vieta gives

x+y+z=0,b=xyz.

Conversely, every distinct zero-sum triple in D gives such a qualifying Q.

No zero-sum triple contains 279936. Two negative elements cannot be cancelled by a positive element because

192+194>380.

Thus every qualifying triple is uniquely

{x,e−x,−e},

where

e∈{192,194,…,570},max(1,e−380)≤x<e/2.

Its raw color is

c=−ex(e−x)(modp).

There are exactly

192≤e≤380

e even
	​

∑
	​

(380−
2

	​

)=13490+13490=26980

qualifying support triples.

Exact integer deduplication of their products gives:

∣Z
raw
	​

∣=26245.

The multiplicity check is

25584⋅1+595⋅2+58⋅3+8⋅4=26980,

so the 26,245 colors comprise 25,584 colors of multiplicity one, 595 of multiplicity two, 58 of multiplicity three, and 8 of multiplicity four. No multiplicity exceeds four. All products have absolute value below 83,000,000<p, so integer equality is exactly equality in F
p
	​

.

The Role02 displayed set

C
190
	​

={−i(190+i)(190+2i):1≤i≤190}

is a 190-element subset of Z
raw
	​

, not the complete numerator.

Thus the strongest packet-supported retained count is

under one endpoint deletion and every banked injective normalization.

	​

avoiding a counterpacket would require at least

26244−130=26114

additional official deletions or identifications.

Restricting only to Role02’s displayed subfamily gives its weaker but valid statement:

190⟶189

after one endpoint, so at least

189−130=59

further losses are required.

Charge audit

The planted supports S
i
	​

 are pairwise disjoint, so the matching charge has exact universal cap

A
block
	​

=⌊
3
571
	​

⌋=190.

Its exact charged color subset can be at most C
190
	​

, or C
190
	​

 minus an endpoint color. It cannot cover the other 26,055 raw color values using the disjoint-support theorem.

It is also unpayable:

2
128
⋅190−q

	​

and even after one endpoint,

2
128
⋅189−q
line
	​

=59⋅2
128
−1>0.

Even granting exclusionary removal of all 190 planted colors and one further endpoint color leaves at least

26245−190−1=26054>130

colors. Hence the banked disjoint-block charge does not resolve P190.

Under the natural affine support-action interpretation fixing β=0, P190 also has no nontrivial affine stabilizer. A preserving map must be x↦ax, with a∈D because 1∈D. Preservation of h=279936 excludes every possibility except a=1:

2≤a≤380 gives ah∈
/
D;

a=h gives h
2
∈
/
D;

a=−e, 192≤e≤570, gives a negative value of magnitude eh>53,000,000, outside the negative part of D.

This eliminates that narrow affine-periodic mechanism. It does not settle an undefined broader official support-periodic predicate.

Exact missing receipt

The archive needs a pinned receipt defining a total map

ρ:{official qualifying witnesses}⟶{DROP}∪{(τ,z):z∈K
line
	​

},

together with:

the exact endpoint color IDs or proof that the endpoint lies outside the P190 set;

every chart/support tag τ;

every normalization z↦ν
τ
	​

(z), its poles, and its domain;

the security-event equivalence relation on tagged normalized outputs;

proof of coherence when one raw color has multiple witness supports;

every official charge predicate, its exact final color subset, integer cap A
j
	​

, allocation R
j
	​

, and overlap ownership;

the ledger check

2
128
(∣F∣+
j
∑
	​

)≤q
line
	​

.

A statement such as “one endpoint,” “affine,” or “periodic” is not this receipt because it identifies no color IDs or quotient fibers.

Decisive replay checker

The exact checker should take the P190 source datum and the pinned receipts above, enumerate all 26,980 qualifying triples, form the 26,245 raw slope classes, and return exactly one of:

SOURCE_REJECTED: first false source/APcorr clause and its exact witness;

COLOR_COMPRESSED_OR_CHARGED: complete quotient map or charge ownership, final count, caps, and allocations, with total numerator at most 130;

SOURCE_VALID_LOW_T1_COUNTERPACKET: source and APcorr accepted, all charges resolved, and final numerator greater than 130;

SOURCE_RECEIPT_MISSING_NO_CLAIM: any required function, equivalence, predicate, cap, or allocation absent.

The raw enumerator has no false positives or false negatives because qualifying degree-≤1 witnesses are bijective with the enumerated zero-sum triples by Vieta. The official replay is sound and complete relative to the frozen contract because it applies the supplied total final map and every registered charge to every enumerated witness/color class and uses exact integer arithmetic.

A useful APcorr rejection witness is already available. If ν(λ) denotes the Fourier transform of the three-subset sum map, then the zero fiber has size 26,980, so

λ

=0
∑
	​

∣ν(λ)∣≥p⋅26980−(

571
	​

).

Any official APcorr clause imposing a smaller bound rejects P190 immediately. No such official clause or threshold appears in the packet.

Self-audit

Proved: the natural LOW raw-color map, the 26,980 qualifying supports, the 26,245 same-slope-deduplicated colors, zero loss from every banked injective affine/tagged normalization, absence of the canonical contained/tangent/residue-quotient mechanisms, and failure of the disjoint-block charge to cover or pay the packet.

Not proved: official source acceptance, official APcorr acceptance, the identity of the endpoint color, the official retained normalization, or absence of a broader support-periodic/affine source rejection.

Relevance: the enumeration is an exact finite/model and source-route certificate. It is not yet an official-prize counterpacket.

A full official solution is not derivable from this packet. The first converter is the frozen source/APcorr/final-color receipt above: acceptance plus an injective retained map yields a counterpacket; rejection must name the first failed clause; compression must exhibit at least 26,114 exact losses under the full natural map, or at minimum the previously targeted 59 losses on the displayed subfamily.
