EXACT_NEW_WALL
1. Executive verdict and confidence

Verdict: none of the three requested terminal labels is justified from the attached packet.

SOURCE_VALID_LOW_T1_COUNTERPACKET is blocked because official AP_corr and the official source adapter are absent.

T1_BLOCK_PACKET_CHARGED is blocked because the official affine-color, support-periodic, retained-normalization, and charge-allocation definitions are absent.

T1_APCORR_LOCAL_LIMIT is blocked because there is no frozen official AP_corr from which to prove descent.

Confidence: high.

There is nevertheless a sharp mathematical classification:

Packet/mechanism	Decision
Residue-algebra quotient at intrinsic t=1	FREE
Hidden action-rank drop in K
line
	​

[X]/(X−β)	FREE
Fixed affine color normalization	FREE
Genuinely retained, tagged affine normalization	FREE

Interval/affine-prefix packets of Roles01–03	UNDECIDED officially; they are free from residue quotient/action-rank and fixed normalization, but “support-periodic” and “affine-color” are undefined broadly enough that no official decision follows

The central referee finding is:

Naming a packet “affine” or “periodic” is not a q-ledger receipt. In the relevant packets, the exact affine or quotient image still has m distinct K

	​

-colors. Therefore the cap is at least m, and a charge is paid only if 2

line
	​

 reserve.

BANKABLE_LEMMA
2. Exact theorem: t=1 affine/periodic/normalization separation

Let K=K
line
	​

, let

E=X−β,β∈
/
D,

and suppose the intrinsic LOW direction satisfies

[B]
E
	​

=b∈K
×
.

Let Q be a family of qualifying degree-≤k witnesses and

Z={Q(β):Q∈Q}⊆K

the deduplicated color set.

(A) Residue quotient and hidden action rank are impossible at t=1

There is a canonical K-algebra isomorphism

K[X]/(X−β)
∼
	​

K,[f]↦f(β).

Consequently:

there is no nonzero proper unital K-algebra quotient of the residue algebra;

for every source-visible rational function R regular at β,

K[R(β)]=K,

so its K-action rank is exactly

1=t;

a charge requiring residue action rank <t cannot occur.

Thus the Cycle110 statement is correct only in this precise sense:

residue quotient/action-rank charge is FREE at t=1.
	​


It says nothing about a quotient or group action on D, w, or the witness-support hypergraph.

(B) Fixed affine normalization cannot reduce colors

The LOW slope coordinate and evaluation color differ by a fixed affine bijection

z⟼bz+c,b

=0,

for an appropriate fixed c. Hence

∣{bz+c:z∈Z}∣=∣Z∣.

More generally, suppose every color has a retained tag τ(z), and the normalization on tag t is

ν
t
	​

(x)=a
t
	​

x+c
t
	​

,a
t
	​


=0.

Then

z⟼(τ(z),ν
τ(z)
	​

(z))

is injective. A genuinely retained normalization therefore cannot merge colors.

Hence:

fixed affine normalization and fully retained normalization are FREE.
	​


A reduction is possible only by dropping tags, introducing poles, or proving a nontrivial transition-fiber cap. None is supplied in the packet.

(C) Exact affine-pencil evaluation cap

Suppose a block packet lies in an affine pencil

Q
c
	​

=R+cH,c∈C⊆K.

Then

Q
c
	​

(β)=R(β)+cH(β).

Therefore

∣{Q
c
	​

(β):c∈C}∣=
⎩
⎨
⎧
	​

1,
∣C∣,
	​

H(β)=0,
H(β)

=0.
	​


In particular, the Role06-style packet

Q
i
	​

=R+c
i
	​


has H=1, so H(β)=1, and its exact color count is

A
0
	​

=∣{c
i
	​

}∣=m.

It is incorrect to charge this packet with cap “one affine pencil.” The q-ledger cap is the number of distinct evaluated parameters, namely m.

Thus:

affine-pencil structure alone gives no color saving when H(β)

=0.
	​


If m>q
line
	​

/2
128
, the affine charge is unpayable with the native line denominator.

(D) Exact affine-involution quotient certificate

For the Role08 packet,

D={±r
1
	​

,…,±r
m
	​

},β=0,M(X)=X
2
,

with distinct r
i
2
	​

, define

τ(x)=−x.

Then:

τ is a nontrivial affine involution of D;

τ(β)=β;

w(x)=x
2
 satisfies w(τx)=w(x);

each witness support is one orbit

S
i
	​

={r
i
	​

,−r
i
	​

};

the quotient map is

π(x)=x
2
;

the corresponding constant witness is

Q
i
	​

=M−(X−r
i
	​

)(X+r
i
	​

)=r
i
2
	​

.

Hence the quotient-color image has exactly

A
0
	​

=
	​

{r
i
2
	​

}
	​

=m.

This is a genuine source-visible support quotient, not merely an analogy.

Therefore the affine-involution packet is:

CHARGED by an exact C
2
	​

-support quotient, with cap A
0
	​

=m.
	​


But this is a paid charge only if

2
128
m≤R
periodic
	​

,

where R
periodic
	​

≤q
line
	​

 is its explicit allocation.

In the Role08 two-color replay,

m=2,q
line
	​

=3
81
<2
129
=2
128
m.

Thus the exact periodic cap is not paid there. The quotient certificate prevents a false FREE label, but it does not produce T1_BLOCK_PACKET_CHARGED.

(E) Exact disjoint-support matching charge

Suppose one selected witness support is retained for each of m colors, all supports have size

a=k+σ,

and these supports are pairwise disjoint. Then

ma≤n,m≤⌊
k+σ
n
	​

⌋.

This yields a completely source-visible charge class:

T1_DISJOINT_SUPPORT_MATCHING,A
0
	​

=m

for a packet-specific receipt, or

A
0
	​

=⌊
k+σ
n
	​

⌋

as a universal matching cap.

For the Role04 planted packet, the m three-point supports are disjoint and its original construction assumes

p=q
line
	​

>2
128
m.

Hence that particular packet satisfies

2
128
A
0
	​

=2
128
m<q
line
	​

.

So Role04's original sparse planted-block packet is q-ledger chargeable by the matching theorem.

This is a new exact source-route charge theorem. It is not shown in the files to be an official prize charge class.

(F) Role04 is not covered by bounded affine pencils

Role04's witnesses have the form

Q
i
	​

(X)=a
i
	​

X+b
i
	​

,

where

a
i
	​

=m
2
+3mi+3i
2
,b
i
	​

=−i(m+i)(m+2i).

Consider any affine line in the coefficient plane,

ua+vb=w,(u,v)

=(0,0).

Substitution gives

−2vi
3
+(3u−3mv)i
2
+(3mu−m
2
v)i+(um
2
−w)=0.

This is a nonzero polynomial of degree at most three:

if v

=0, the cubic coefficient is nonzero;

if v=0, then u

=0 and the polynomial has degree at most two but is nonzero.

Therefore every affine pencil contains at most three Q
i
	​

. A union of J affine pencils contains at most

3J

of the packet's colors.

Thus a bounded-J affine-pencil charge does not charge the whole planted packet when m>3J. Any broader affine-color rule must be stated separately.

PROOF
3. Packet-by-packet referee decision
Block packets

There are two materially different block mechanisms in the Cycle111 returns.

Affine-pencil block patch Q
i
	​

=R+c
i
	​

H

Decision: UNDECIDED officially.

It has an exact affine-pencil certificate, but:

if H(β)=0, the packet collapses to one color;

if H(β)

=0, the exact cap is A
0
	​

=m.

The block-affine packet in Role06 has H=1, so its cap is m. If it is an above-threshold packet, merely assigning T1_AFFINE_COLOR_CHARGE does not pay it.

Disjoint planted equal-prefix blocks

Decision: CHARGED by the source-route matching theorem, with

A
0
	​

=m≤⌊
k+σ
n
	​

⌋.

For Role04's original choice q
line
	​

>2
128
m, this cap is paid. It is nevertheless not an official T1_BLOCK_PACKET_CHARGED, because the packet contains no official matching-charge declaration or allocation.

A bounded affine-pencil rule cannot replace this matching charge: it captures at most 3J witnesses.

Prefix/interval packets

This covers the interval and affine-progression constructions in Roles01–03.

Decision: UNDECIDED officially.

What is exact:

residue quotient: FREE;

hidden residue action rank: FREE;

fixed affine color normalization: FREE;

directly retained normalization: FREE;

proper-subfield confinement: absent in the prime-field versions;

nonzero translational period of the full proper subset D⊊F
p
	​

: impossible, because every nonzero translation has one orbit of size p;

the primitive-power padding defeats the stated bounded-defect multiplicative-coset test.

What is not decided:

whether an arithmetic progression, short restricted-sum image, large additive energy, reflection symmetry of the active interval, or Prouhet trade structure is officially called periodic or affine-color;

whether the official rule acts on all of D, on the active support hypergraph, on the graph of w, or on a source-decorated normalization;

its exact cap and allocation.

Moreover, the Roles01–03 scalable packets have free-color counts already exceeding q
line
	​

/2
128
. Therefore any charge covering all dangerous colors has

A
0
	​

≥N
packet
	​

>
2
128
q
line
	​

	​

,

and cannot satisfy

2
128
A
0
	​

≤q
line
	​

.

Such a packet must therefore be:

rejected by the official source predicate before entering the numerator; or

handled by a separate protocol transfer theorem.

Merely renaming its additive concentration “periodic” cannot close the ledger.

Affine-involution packet

Decision: CHARGED structurally by the exact τ(x)=−x support quotient, cap

A
0
	​

=m.

For the explicit final-budget-violating Role08 replay, the cap is unpaid:

2
128
m>q
line
	​

.

Thus its correct terminal is not T1_BLOCK_PACKET_CHARGED. It remains a structured route cut unless official AP_corr excludes the datum or a different allocated reserve is proved.

Retained normalization

Decision: FREE for all direct Cycle111 constructions, under the ordinary meaning of “retained.”

The product-to-color map in the monic-anchor packets is

u⟼M(β)−u,

a fixed bijection. No support-dependent denominator or pole is used.

An official source adapter may have additional charts. That source-level question is UNDECIDED because the chart maps, tags, pole sets, and transition-fiber bounds are absent.

Hidden action rank

Decision: FREE.

The only defined residue object is one-dimensional. A support-action notion must not be silently substituted for residue action rank. If the official term “hidden action rank” also refers to support or domain actions, that is a different missing definition.

ROUTE_CUT
4. Why no official terminal is derivable

The attached files do not contain an official definition with inputs and outputs for any of:

AP
corr
	​

,AFFINE_COLOR,SUPPORT_PERIODIC,RETAINED_NORMALIZATION,HIDDEN_ACTION_RANK.

Nor do they specify:

the charged subset of Z;

whether charge classes overlap;

the cap attached to each class;

the amount of q
line
	​

 reserve allocated to each class;

whether a charge is exclusionary or contributes an additive numerator;

the source-to-packet adapter required to evaluate the predicates.

This creates literal logical underdetermination. Two incompatible completions are both consistent with the packet:

Narrow completion: “periodic” means a proper quotient of K[X]/(E), and affine normalization means a fixed bijection. Then the scalable prefix packets are free from these mechanisms.

Broad completion: “periodic/affine” includes short restricted-sum images, active-support reflections, block matchings, or large prefix Fourier mass. Then the same packets can be rejected or charged.

No statement in the supplied files selects one completion. Consequently, an official FREE or CHARGED judgment cannot be inferred.

AUDIT
5. Verification and replay requirements

A decisive replay must include the following trusted objects.

Source receipt

the official source datum;

the exact source adapter producing D,β,w,E,B;

an executable or formal AP_corr predicate;

proof that it evaluates true.

Affine-color receipt

For each charged pencil, provide

(R
j
	​

,H
j
	​

,C
j
	​

)

and calculate the actual evaluated image

{R
j
	​

(β)+cH
j
	​

(β):c∈C
j
	​

}.

The cap must count this image, not the number of pencils.

Periodic/quotient receipt

Provide:

group generators or a quotient map;

proof that the action preserves the required decorated datum;

whether β must be fixed;

action on w and on colors;

the exact quotient-color image and cap.

An affine automorphism can be checked without scanning all of AGL(1,K): it is determined by the images of two distinct domain points, so all candidates arise from O(n
4
) ordered-pair mappings.

Retained-normalization receipt

Provide:

chart tags;

affine maps and coefficients;

pole sets;

proof of injectivity after retaining tags;

an exact bound on any transition-map fibers if tags are coarsened.

Role09 remains OCR supporting evidence only.

normalization branch, with retained tags and an exact transition-fiber cap;

and then prove the literal combined q

The counterpacket-side construction that would settle the other direction is equally exact:

choose fixed m>3J+2;

take p∈(2

construct m disjoint equal-prefix triples;

make their linear witness coefficient points avoid every J-pencil cover;

make the decorated support hypergraph have trivial affine stabilizer;

retain simple roots and distinct β-colors;

verify official AP_corr.

Then bounded affine-pencil charges, exact support-periodic charges, endpoint removal, residue quotient/action rank, and retained normalization leave more than

⌊p/2

free color. The sole unresolved step would be the official source predicate.
