EXACT_NEW_WALL
1. Executive verdict and confidence

No official terminal output among the three permitted outcomes is justified from the supplied packet.

The packet contains no frozen definition or evaluator for the official source adapter, AP_corr, support-periodic charge, affine-color charge, or retained normalization. This is explicitly acknowledged in the Cycle110/111 audits and clean returns; searching the packet finds no definition of AP_corr, only proposed substitutes and statements that it remains unfrozen.

I did, however, obtain a stronger exact Cycle111 packet:

same field q
gen
	​

=q
code
	​

=q
line
	​

=p;

intrinsic LOW t=1;

reserve stronger than the strongest Cycle111 calibration;

190 distinct line colors, or 189 after paying one endpoint;

⌊p/2
128
⌋=130;

no same-slope collisions, tangencies, contained/delete-one incidences, proper subfields, residue quotients, hidden action-rank loss, or bounded affine coefficient pencil;

no honest retained-color charge partition can fit the q
line
	​

 ledger.

Therefore the construction terminalizes the remaining issue:

If the frozen official source predicate and AP_corr accept this packet and the retained normalization preserves the explicitly distinct colors, it is immediately a SOURCE_VALID_LOW_T1_COUNTERPACKET.
Otherwise, the first rejecting source clause or a normalization collapsing at least 59 additional colors must be exhibited.

Confidence is high for the construction, reserve, charge-impossibility lemma, and packet-inventory conclusion. Confidence in official source acceptance is unknown, because the relevant predicate is absent.

2. BANKABLE_LEMMA — the exact P

 source-gate packet

Put

T=2
128
,p=130T+1=44236707699722000250238698966129867489281.

This is prime. Indeed,

p=65⋅2
129
+1,

and 6 is a Proth witness:

6
(p−1)/2
≡−1(modp).

Moreover,

p−1=2
129
⋅5⋅13,

and the additional order checks for the prime divisors 2,5,13 show that 6 is primitive.

Work over

,k=1,σ=2,β=0,

,w=M∣

.

Set m=190. For 1≤i≤m, define

S
i
	​

={i, m+i, −(m+2i)}⊂F
p
	​

.

These are pairwise disjoint three-element sets. Let

h=6
7
=279936,D=(
i=1
⋃
190
	​

S
i
	​

)∪{h}.

Thus

n=∣D∣=571.

For each i, define

L
i
	​

(X)=
x∈S
i
	​

∏
	​

(X−x).

Since the sum of the elements of S
i
	​

 is zero,

L

	​

(X)=X

−A
i
	​

X+g

,

where

A
i
	​

=m
2
+3mi+3i

,g
i
	​

=i(m+i)(m+2i).

Hence

Q

(X)=A

	​

X−g
i
	​


has degree at most 1=k, and

Q

	​

(x)=w(x)(x∈S

	​

).

Therefore

At β=0,

The positive integers g

	​

 are strictly increasing, and

g

≤g
m

=6m

Consequently the 190 colors Q
i
	​

After conservatively deleting one endpoint color,

N
retained
	​

≥189.

But

⌊
2

	​

	​

⌋=⌊
T

	​

⌋=130,

so

189>130,2
128
⋅189−p=59⋅2
128
−1>0.

Thus this packet exceeds the security denominator by 59 full color units after endpoint payment.

3. PROOF and charge audit
Corrected reserve

Here

)=30865405.

The packet satisfies not only

	​

),

but the stronger Cycle111 calibration

p
2
≥2
236
n(

	​

).

Indeed,

p
2
>(130T)
2
=2
236
(16900⋅2

while

16900⋅2
20
=17720934400

and

571(
3
571
	​

)=17624146255.

Therefore

p
2
>2
236
⋅571(
3
571
	​

).

Equivalently, this has the extra 108+log
2
	​

n bits of slack used in the strongest Cycle111 reserve audit.

Intrinsic LOW t=1

We have

E=X,E(D)

=0,BmodE=1.

A denominator-degree-zero reduction would require a constant G for which

XG+1

vanishes on at least two distinct domain points. This is impossible for a nonzero linear polynomial. Hence the denominator degree is intrinsically t=1.

Contained and delete-one charges

For k=1, every polynomial G with degG<k is constant. Again,

XG+1

cannot vanish on two distinct points. Thus the contained and delete-j mechanisms relevant at t=1 are empty.

Quotient and hidden action rank

The residue algebra is

F
p
	​

[X]/(X)≅F
p
	​

.

It has dimension 1=t, no nonzero proper unital F
p
	​

-algebra quotient, and no source-visible action-rank drop below t.

This proves only residue-algebra quotient vacuity. It does not define or settle an absent official support-periodic predicate.

Tangencies

=0.

All agreement points are simple. There is no tangent or repeated-root concentration.

Same-slope collisions

The values Q
i
	​

(0)=−g
i
	​

 are pairwise distinct. The numerator is already deduplicated at the final K
line
	​

-color level.

Field confinement

The field is prime, so there is no proper subfield.

Also, D contains 1 and h=6
7
, with h primitive. Hence no proper multiplicative coset contains all of D. Since

p≡2(mod3),

cubing is a permutation of F
p
×
	​

, and h
3
 is primitive. Thus w(D)=D
3
 also contains 1 and a primitive element.

A bounded-defect version is also available: for every explicit 0≤A≤86, reduce m to

m
A
	​

=⌊
3
569−2A
	​

⌋≥132

and add 2A+2 suitably shifted consecutive powers of 6. Then n≤571, at least m
A
	​

−1≥131 colors survive, and every proper multiplicative coset misses at least A+1 padding points in both D and D
3
.

=6(i−j)(i−k)(j−k)(ij+ik+im+jk+jm+km+m
2
).

This is a nonzero integer. Its absolute value is below

42m
5
=10399615800000<p,

so it is nonzero modulo p. Hence no three packet witnesses lie in one affine line in the coefficient plane.

Therefore a charge based on one common affine polynomial pencil cannot absorb this packet. A fixed affine color normalization z↦az+b, a

=0, is bijective and preserves all 190 colors.

This does not settle an unpublished broader meaning of “affine-color charge.”

Retained normalization

The identity normalization already has no pole and is injective. Any support-dependent normalization that retains its support/chart tag also remains injective on these witnesses.

An official normalization that drops the retained tag or identifies colors would need an explicit theorem showing at least 59 additional identifications.

BANKABLE_LEMMA — retained-color charges cannot pay the packet

Suppose the 189 endpoint-paid colors are accepted as official retained colors. Partition them into a free class F and charged classes C
1
	​

,…,C
r
	​

. Let A
j
	​

 be valid caps, so

A
j
	​

≥∣C
j
	​

∣.

If the free class and all charges are paid from allocated portions of the single q
line
	​

 reserve, then

2
128
(∣F∣+
j
∑
	​

A
j
	​

)≤p.

But

∣F∣+
j
∑
	​

A
j
	​

≥∣F∣+
j
∑
	​

∣C
j
	​

∣=189.

Hence such a ledger would imply

2
128
⋅189≤p,

contrary to

2
128
⋅189−p=59⋅2
128
−1>0.

Therefore a source-visible charge cannot repair this packet merely by labelling retained colors as “charged.” It must do at least one of the following:

reject the packet at the official source or AP_corr gate;

prove that at least 59 additional displayed colors are not distinct official colors;

prove that the official retained normalization is noninjective on at least 59 of them;

introduce a denominator transfer theorem beyond q
line
	​

, which the prompt explicitly forbids absent a protocol theorem.

This rules out T1_BLOCK_PACKET_CHARGED for this packet under any honest injective retained-color interpretation.

ROUTE_CUT

The construction cuts three possible evasions.

First, “the block packet can simply be charged” is false without a color-reducing theorem: its retained cardinality already exceeds the entire q
line
	​

 budget.

Second, a bounded affine-pencil charge is insufficient: no three witness polynomials are collinear in coefficient space.

Third, a local-limit theorem cannot be asserted merely from the explicitly stated structural conditions. If the official AP_corr accepts this packet, any theorem implying the required local limit is false on this datum.

The source must therefore provide an additional predicate that rejects this packet—most naturally a source-level sparse-prefix/support-periodic condition—or an exact normalization theorem collapsing at least 59 colors.

4. Verification and replay requirements

The exact arithmetic and construction replay is available here:

Cycle112 Role-02 exact packet checker

It verifies:

the Proth primality certificate;

primitive-root/order receipts;

pairwise disjoint supports;

zero prefix sums;

190 distinct colors;

simple agreements;

intrinsic t=1;

the base and strengthened corrected reserves;

the exact 2
−128
 violation;

multiplicative-coset escape;

maximum affine coefficient-pencil occupancy 2.

The packet’s own SHA256SUMS.txt also replayed successfully.

Official promotion requires four additional supplied objects that are absent from the archive:

	​

SOURCE_LOW_T1(P
190
	​

),
AP_CORR(P
190
	​

),
OFFICIAL_CHARGE_PARTITION(P
190
	​

),
RETAINED_NORMALIZATION(P
190
	​

).
	​


A replay must return the exact first false source clause, not merely the label “periodic,” “affine,” or “correlated.” If it claims a charge or normalization, it must identify at least 59 additional lost colors and verify the complete integer reserve allocation.

5. EXACT_NEW_WALL — next exact lemma
L-CYCLE113-P190-SOURCE-REPLAY-OR-59-COLOR-COLLAPSE
	​


For the packet P
190
	​

 above, prove exactly one:

Official acceptance.

SOURCE_LOW_T1(P
190
	​

)∧AP_CORR(P
190
	​

)

and the official retained normalization leaves at least 131 colors.
This immediately yields SOURCE_VALID_LOW_T1_COUNTERPACKET.

Exact source rejection.
Exhibit the first formal official source or AP_corr clause that fails, with its literal hypothesis and calculation on P
190
	​

.

Exact color reduction.
Exhibit an official source-visible charge or normalization that removes or merges at least 59 additional endpoint-paid colors, together with its exact cap and the complete q
line
	​

 allocation.

No further broad Fourier or local-limit attack should precede this replay: any such theorem must first say why it does not apply to P
190
	​

.

AUDIT — Mandatory self-audit

Proved:

explicit same-field intrinsic LOW t=1+ strong corrected reserve
+ all formally checkable degeneracies absent⟹189>⌊q
line
	​

/2
128
⌋.
	​


Also proved: no injective retained-color charge partition can pay these 189 colors from the q
line
	​

 reserve.

Not proved:

SOURCE_LOW_T1(P
190
	​

)orAP_CORR(P
190
	​

),

because neither predicate is defined in the packet. I also did not prove absence of an undefined official support-periodic or broader affine-color exclusion.

2. Relevance level

This is a source-route-relevant theorem, an exact q-ledger theorem, and a replayable finite certificate.

It is not yet an official prize counterpacket.

Under the only explicit Cycle110 structural scaffold, it is a conditional COUNTERPACKET.

3. First possible failure line

The first unresolved implication is

That implication is not formulable from the supplied files.

5. Possible numerator reductions

Quotient and hidden action rank: absent at t=1.

Contained/delete-one: absent by degree.

Same-slope collisions: absent.

Tangency: absent.

Proper subfield: absent.

Multiplicative-coset confinement: absent in the exact zero-defect packet; bounded-defect padding works through A=86.

Fixed affine normalization: bijective.

Bounded affine witness pencil: maximum occupancy 2.

Endpoint: one color already paid.

Retained-tag normalization: injective.

Support-periodic or broader affine-color exclusion: undecidable from the packet because the official predicates are absent.

6. Conversion requirement

This result is not merely a PLAN. The mathematical packet and q-ledger obstruction are complete.

Conversion to official COUNTERPACKET requires the literal official source/AP_corr replay and retained-normalization receipt. Conversion to PROOF or T1_BLOCK_PACKET_CHARGED requires an exact rejection or a theorem eliminating at least 59 additional colors; a bare charge label is insufficient.
