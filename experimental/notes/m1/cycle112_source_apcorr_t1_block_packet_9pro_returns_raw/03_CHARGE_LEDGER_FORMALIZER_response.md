ROUTE_CUT
1. Executive verdict and confidence

Verdict: no T1_BLOCK_PACKET_CHARGED certificate can pay the clean Cycle111 Role03 packet using a literal, non-double-spent q
line
	​

 ledger.

The obstruction is stronger than the absence of frozen official charge predicates. After the endpoint allowance is deducted, the packet has

M>⌊
2
128
q
line
	​

	​

⌋

distinct retained K
line
	​

-colors. Any additive charge partition covering those colors, together with the free-color reserve, must therefore consume more than the entire q
line
	​

 reserve.

Consequently, an affine-color, periodic, prefix-design, or restricted-sum label cannot repair this packet. The route can continue only through:

an official source predicate that rejects the packet before it enters the line-color numerator; or

a nontrivial source theorem proving that many distinct colors correspond to fewer effective security events; or

T1_APCORR_LOCAL_LIMIT, excluding this concentration from the accepted uncharged domain.

Confidence: high for the q-ledger route cut; unknown for official AP_corr acceptance because the official predicate is not frozen in the packet.

This is a q-ledger theorem with source-route consequences, not an official prize theorem and not a source-valid counterpacket.

2. Exact theorem
BANKABLE_LEMMA
L-CYCLE112-T1-Q_LINE-CHARGE-CONSERVATION

Let Z
ret
	​

 be the set of distinct final K
line
	​

-colors after:

endpoint deletion,

exact same-slope and same-color deduplication,

all proved cardinality-preserving affine normalizations,

retention of every normalization or chart tag required by the source.

A valid additive q

Then necessarily

∣Z

∣≤q

	​

.

Therefore, if

∣Z
ret
	​

∣>⌊
2
128
q
line
	​

	​

⌋,

no such additive charge ledger exists.

In particular, if one proposed charge class covers the whole packet, its smallest honest cap is

A
0
	​

≥∣Z
ret
	​

∣,

and hence

2
128
A

.

It cannot satisfy

Summing the disjoint ownership counts gives

This contradicts 2

If charge classes overlap, assign each retained color to exactly one applicable class. Disjointization can only decrease each owned class size, so overlapping labels do not evade the argument.

A purported ledger that checks

line
	​


separately for every active class, while failing to check the sum of allocations, double-spends q

	​

 and is invalid. ∎

3. Application and detailed charge obstruction
3.1 The clean above-budget packet

The Cycle111 Role03 construction fixes

σ=2,k=A−2,

and may take

A=4,k=2.

It uses one prime field throughout:

K
gen
	​

=K
code
	​

=K
line
	​

=F
p
	​

,q
gen
	​

=q
code
	​

=q
line
	​

=p.

Writing

N=(
A
n
	​

),

the construction satisfies the corrected reserve premise

p
2
≥2
128
N.

Let V
β
	​

 be the number of distinct product/evaluation colors obtained after exact collision deduplication. The construction pays the complete endpoint allowance by subtracting one color and obtains

M:=V
β
	​

−1.

Equation (21) of role03_symmetric_fiber_theorist_response.md proves, whenever

k<
12
2
128
	​

,

that

2
128
p
	​

<V
β
	​

−1=M.

For k=2, therefore,

2
128
M>p=q
line
	​

.

Since M is an integer,

M>⌊
2
128
q
line
	​

	​

⌋.

The charge-conservation lemma now applies. Even granting the whole q
line
	​

 reserve to this one packet, its minimum cardinality cap is

A
0
min
	​

=M,

and

2
128
A
0
min
	​

>q
line
	​

.

Hence no output of type T1_BLOCK_PACKET_CHARGED is possible for this retained color set under ordinary additive q
line
	​

-charge semantics.

The corrected reserve p
2
≥2
128
N does not change this conclusion. It is a generation/entropy-side condition. The final color denominator remains p, not p
2
.

3.2 Classification is not payment

A charge predicate may correctly detect that the packet has affine, periodic, block, or restricted-prefix structure. That alone does not produce a payable cap.

For example, declaring “this is one affine pencil” does not justify A
0
	​

=1 when the pencil contains M distinct retained K
line
	​

-colors. Such a cap requires a theorem proving that the M colors contribute at most one effective security event. No such event-compression or probability-transfer theorem is present in the packet.

The same applies to a periodic orbit count, a prefix-design matching count, or a Prouhet-type label. Either:

the cap counts the retained distinct events, in which case it is at least M and fails the ledger; or

it is smaller than M, in which case a separate source-visible compression theorem is required.

The latter is substantively T1_APCORR_LOCAL_LIMIT or a q-ledger transfer theorem, not a bare structural charge.

3.3 Named charge audit
Charge mechanism	Exact current status	Ledger consequence
Endpoint	One color is already subtracted in M=V
β
	​

−1.	Cannot reduce M further without a new endpoint theorem.
Field confinement	The packet uses F
p
	​

, which has no proper subfield.	No proper-subfield cap applies.
Additive confinement	The additive group of F
p
	​

 has no nontrivial proper subgroup.	No subgroup numerator reduction.
Multiplicative confinement	The Cycle111 receipt places a primitive ratio in an active support.	A single proper multiplicative-coset cap does not apply.
Affine color	A global affine normalization D=b+[n] is bijective. An eventual official affine-packet predicate remains unresolved.	A bijection preserves M. If an affine charge owns the packet, its cardinality cap is at least M, hence unpayable.
Tangent	Agreement roots in the construction are simple.	No model tangent multiplicity. An unknown official tangent predicate cannot be asserted absent, but no tangent cap is supplied.
Contained/delete-one	The Cycle111 degree receipts rule out the stated contained/delete-one branches.	No certified reduction of the retained color count.
Quotient	K[X]/(X−β)≅K.	No nonzero proper unital residue-algebra quotient.
Hidden action rank	The residue action has rank 1=t.	Rank-drop charge is vacuous.
Support periodicity	Not equivalent to residue-algebra periodicity and not frozen officially.	It may classify or source-exclude the packet, but no exact payable cap exists in the files.
Same-slope collisions	V
β
	​

 is defined after exact product/color collision deduplication.	Already paid before M is formed.
Retained normalization	Fixed normalization is bijective; support-dependent charts must retain their tags.	Silent merging of colors is invalid.
Restricted-sum/local-limit	This is exactly the missing theorem.	Renaming the concentrated fiber as a charge gives A
0
	​

≥M and fails. A genuine local-limit theorem could instead exclude or bound the accepted residual.

Thus the only unresolved named mechanisms—principally affine-color and support-periodic structure—can still resolve source admissibility, but they cannot pay the retained numerator merely by being declared active.

4. Verification and replay requirements

A charge checker should accept a T1_BLOCK_PACKET_CHARGED certificate only after all of the following are supplied.

Packet replay

Canonicalize every final color as an element of K
line
	​

.

Verify the same-color and same-slope deduplication.

Verify the endpoint set and form the actual retained set Z
ret
	​

.

Verify every affine or chart normalization is injective on retained tagged objects.

Recompute

M=∣Z
ret
	​

∣.

Perform the early exact check

2
128
M≤q
line
	​

.

If it fails, no ordinary q
line
	​

-paid partition can succeed.

For the Role03 packet, the replay target is

2
128
(V
β
	​

−1)>p.
Charge replay

For every active charge class, require:

the exact official source predicate;

the exact owned retained-color set;

an integer cap A
i
	​

;

a proof that the cap bounds those owned colors or effective events;

an integer reserve allocation R
i
	​

;

the inequality 2
128
A
i
	​

≤R
i
	​

.

The checker must also construct the literal free set and verify

2
128
∣F∣≤R
free
	​

,

followed by the no-double-spend condition

R
free
	​

+
i
∑
	​

R
i
	​

≤q
line
	​

.

Assertions embedded in a model file or JSON object are not source receipts.

Q-ledger replay

q
line
	​

 is the sole final color/security denominator.

q
gen
	​

 may enter an entropy term only after a source theorem proves the corresponding entropy loss.

q
code
	​

 is not an additional reserve.

q
chal
	​

 is unused.

Same-field equality does not permit multiplying or adding the denominators. In particular, q
gen
	​

=q
line
	​

=p does not turn the final line reserve into p
2
.

The supplied archive’s SHA-256 manifest replayed successfully.

5. Next exact lemma
EXACT_NEW_WALL
L-CYCLE113-OFFICIAL-APCORR-TO-PREFIX-FOURIER-FLATNESS-OR-SOURCE-EXCLUSION

Let U
free
	​

 be the officially accepted, uncharged support family after all exact source exclusions, and define the prefix map

Φ(S)=(e
1
	​

(S),…,e
σ−1
	​

(S))∈G:=K
gen
σ−1
	​

.

The needed noncircular source theorem is:

Frozen official AP_corr, together with absence of the official charged branches, implies a number Δ
off
	​

 such that for every nontrivial additive character χ∈
G
,

	​

S∈U
free
	​

∑
	​

χ(Φ(S))
	​

≤Δ
off
	​

.

Fourier inversion would then give the exact prefix-fiber cap

c∈G
max
	​

#{S∈U
free
	​

:Φ(S)=c}≤A
LL
	​

,

where

A
LL

=⌈

+(1−

and

∣G∣=q

The remaining required ledger is

,R

i
∑

	​

.

This formulation isolates the actual missing implication. The Fourier inversion is elementary; the difficult, source-relevant statement is the descent

\text{official `AP_corr`} \Longrightarrow \text{nontrivial-character bound}.

Alternatively, official AP_corr must explicitly reject the Role03 affine-prefix packet and identify the first violated source clause. There is no third purely additive charge route once its retained numerator is already above the complete q
line
	​

 budget.

AUDIT
1. Exact implication proved and not proved

Proved: every non-double-spent additive q
line
	​

 ledger covering a retained color set Z
ret
	​

 implies

2
128
∣Z
ret
	​

∣≤q
line
	​

.

Therefore an already above-budget retained packet cannot be repaired by partitioning its colors among endpoint, affine, periodic, prefix, or other q
line
	​

-paid charges.

Not proved: that official AP_corr accepts the Role03 packet; that it rejects it; that any official affine or support-periodic predicate is absent; or that an official event-compression theorem cannot exist.

2. Relevance classification

The charge-conservation lemma is q-ledger-only, but it is directly source-route-relevant because it eliminates the purely additive charge branch for an accepted above-budget packet.

It is not an official prize theorem. The Role03 application remains a model/source-route certificate until official AP_corr is replayed.

3. First possible failure line

The first unproved source line is

\text{Cycle111 intrinsic/model receipts} \Longrightarrow \text{official `AP_corr` accepts the packet}.

Conditional on acceptance, the first failure in the charge route is

affine/periodic/prefix structural classification⟹a payable cap on retained line events.

No such implication or cap is frozen.

4. Q-denominator correctness

q
line
	​

=p is used for the final inequality.

q
gen
	​

=p is used only in the corrected reserve premise and would require a source theorem before supplying any prefix-entropy loss.

q
code
	​

=p supplies no free denominator.

q
chal
	​

 is not used.

The exact target is 2
128
N≤q
line
	​

, with integer floors handled explicitly.

5. Possible reductions or charges

Quotient rank, hidden action rank, contained incidences, tangent multiplicity, field confinement, same-slope collisions, retained normalization, and the endpoint allowance do not reduce the Role03 retained count beyond what is already reflected in M.

Affine-color and support-periodic structure could still cause official source rejection or support a genuine compression theorem. They cannot reduce M merely by attaching a label. Restricted-sum/Fourier control could reduce the accepted numerator, but that is precisely the missing local-limit theorem.

6. Conversion requirement

This answer is not a PLAN; it is a proved route cut.

To convert the route into PROOF or COUNTERPACKET, the exact next receipt is one of:

replay official AP_corr on the A=4,σ=2,k=2 Role03 family and prove acceptance with every official source-exclusion predicate absent; this would promote the above-budget packet toward SOURCE_VALID_LOW_T1_COUNTERPACKET; or

identify the exact official clause rejecting it; or

prove L-CYCLE113-OFFICIAL-APCORR-TO-PREFIX-FOURIER-FLATNESS-OR-SOURCE-EXCLUSION with a literal q
line
	​

 allocation.
