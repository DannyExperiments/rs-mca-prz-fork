EXACT_NEW_WALL

No full solve. There is, however, a lossless official-source adapter that bypasses the low/balanced/high-denominator normalization problem entirely.

The first unresolved line is no longer source-slope normalization. It is:

AP
corr
int
	​

⟹polynomial-degree separator for the resulting syndrome-pencil readout.

Under the literal denominator-based aperiodicity definition in the packet, an even earlier line fails: aperiodicity does not descend to any undecorated line-level Gate B object because denominator presentations are noncanonical.

Confidence: high for the adapter and the descent obstruction; unknown for the required separator theorem.

BANKABLE_LEMMA
L-CYCLE108-OFFICIAL-SYNDROME-PENCIL-ADAPTER

Let K=F
line
	​

, let H=αμ
n
	​

⊂K
×
, and let

C=RS[K,H,k],a=k+σ,m=n−a,

with 1≤σ≤n−k. Let f,g∈K
H
, and let F,G∈K[X]
<n
	​

 be their unique interpolating polynomials.

Write

Ω
H
	​

(X)=
x∈H
∏
	​

(X−x)=X
n
−α
n
.

For T∈(
m
H
	​

), put

L
T
	​

(X)=
x∈T
∏
	​

(X−x)

and define the top-σ projection

Top
σ
	​

(P)=([X

]P,…,[X

.

Set

A(T)=Top
σ
	​

(L
T
	​

F),B(T)=Top
σ
	​

(L
T
	​

G).

Then the official support-wise MCA-bad set at agreement at least a is exactly

Bad
off
	​

(f,g)={z∈K:∃T∈(
m
H
	​

), B(T)

=0, A(T)+zB(T)=0}.
	​

(1)

This is valid simultaneously for every intrinsic denominator degree. In particular, no low/balanced/high split is needed to obtain a fixed Gate B object.

A(T)=M

The map

z⟼(j,z),z∈Θ

	​

,

is injective. There are exactly σ≤n possible pivot tags. The chart data are independent of the slope and of its chosen witness.

Appending the intrinsic-degree tag

reg(τ(g))∈{τ(g)<σ, τ(g)=σ, τ(g)>σ}

multiplies the chart count by at most three. Thus the tag count is O(n), with exponent independent of s=a and k.

Source-residue form

For an official degree-t residue datum (E,N,w), set as words on H

f=
E
w
	​

,g=−
E
N
	​

.

A witness Q
z
	​

 satisfies

Q
z
	​

≡zN(modE),Q
z
	​

=w on S.

Then

P
z
	​

=
E
Q
z
	​

−zN
	​

∈K[X]
<k
	​


and P
z
	​

=f+zg on S. The source noncontainment condition is exactly the condition that g is not degree-<k explainable on S. Hence (1)–(4) apply directly to every official residue datum, with no assumption on t.

PROOF

This proves the BANKABLE_LEMMA only, not the full Cycle108 target.

1. Reduction to exact agreement size

Suppose z is officially bad with witness S
0
	​

, ∣S
0
	​

∣≥a. Since f+zg is explained on S
0
	​

, condition (ii) is equivalent to g not being explained on S
0
	​

: if g had a degree-<k explanation, subtracting zg would also explain f.

Assume every a-subset S⊆S
0
	​

 explained g. For each such S, choose G
S
	​

∈K[X]
<k
	​

 explaining g on S. Adjacent a-subsets have intersection size

a−1=k+σ−1≥k,

so their explaining polynomials are equal. The Johnson graph on the a-subsets of S
0
	​

 is connected, hence all G
S
	​

 coincide and explain g on S
0
	​

, a contradiction.

Thus every bad slope has an exact a-point witness.

2. Agreement implies the top-σ equations

Fix S⊆H, ∣S∣=a, and put T=H∖S, ∣T∣=m.

Suppose F+zG agrees on S with P∈K[X]
<k
	​

. Then

F+zG−P=L
S
	​

R

for some R∈K[X]
<m
	​

. Multiplying by L
T
	​

 gives

L
T
	​

(F+zG)−L
T
	​

P=Ω
H
	​

R.
(5)

Now

deg(L
T
	​

P)≤m+k−1=n−σ−1.

Also

Ω
H
	​

R=(X
n
−α
n
)R

has terms only in degrees below m or at least n. Therefore neither term on the right side of (5) has coefficients in degrees

n−σ,…,n−1.

Hence

A(T)+zB(T)=0.
3. The top-σ equations imply agreement

Conversely, assume

A(T)+zB(T)=0.

Divide L
T
	​

(F+zG) by Ω
H
	​

:

L
T
	​

(F+zG)=Ω
H
	​

R+W,degW<n.
(6)

Because degL
T
	​

(F+zG)≤n+m−1, one has degR<m.

Reduction modulo X
n
−α
n
 sends every term X
n+i
, 0≤i<m, into degree i<m. Consequently, the coefficients of W in degrees n−σ,…,n−1 equal those of L
T
	​

(F+zG), and therefore vanish. Thus

degW≤n−σ−1.
(7)

For every x∈T, both L
T
	​

(F+zG) and Ω
H
	​

R vanish. Hence W vanishes on T, so

W=L
T
	​

P

for some polynomial P. From (7),

degP≤n−σ−1−m=k−1.

For x∈S, Ω
H
	​

(x)=0 and L
T
	​

(x)

=0. Equation (6) therefore gives

F(x)+zG(x)=P(x).

So f+zg has a degree-<k explanation on S.

4. Noncontainment is exactly B(T)

=0

Apply the preceding equivalence to g alone. It shows

g∣
S
	​

∈C∣
S
	​

⟺B(T)=0.

Since f+zg is already explained on S, official badness is equivalent to g not being explained there. Thus the additional condition is precisely

B(T)

=0.

This proves (1).

5. Pivot charts and injectivity

For every active T, let j be the first coordinate for which B
j
	​

(T)

=0. From A(T)+zB(T)=0,

z=−A
j
	​

(T)/B
j
	​

(T)

and

A
i
	​

(T)B
j
	​

(T)−A
j
	​

(T)B
i
	​

(T)=0

for every i. This proves (3)–(4).

A slope belonging to several Θ
j
	​

 because it has several witnesses is assigned to the least such j. Distinct source slopes remain distinct because the readout parameter is the original z; no affine collapse occurs.

6. The pencil loses no line-level source information

The matrix M
f
	​

 contains every coefficient f
i
	​

 with k≤i<n. Explicitly,

f
i
	​

=(M
f
	​

)
0,n−σ−i
	​

,k≤i≤n−σ,

and

f
i
	​

=(M
f
	​

)
i−(n−σ),0
	​

,n−σ<i<n.

The same holds for M
g
	​

. Hence

(M
f
	​

,M
g
	​

)

determines the two codeword-gauge classes

[f],[g]∈K
H
/C.

Therefore every source predicate invariant under adding codewords to f and g—including any correctly defined intrinsic denominator degree, intrinsic quotient/action-rank property, or field-of-definition property—descends losslessly to the syndrome pencil.

A predicate depending on the chosen residue presentation (E,N,w), rather than the line modulo codewords, does not necessarily descend. That is the next route cut.

7. Endpoint

When m=0, T=∅ is the only complement. The equation is

A(∅)+zB(∅)=0,B(∅)

=0.

It has at most one solution z. Thus every full-support endpoint contributes at most one distinct official slope. This covers all a=n, not only the earlier k=1,σ=n−1 endpoint.

ROUTE_CUT
Literal denominator aperiodicity is presentation-gauge dependent

Under the attached definition, a residue datum is called quotient-periodic when its chosen denominator is a pullback through X↦X
M
. This property does not factor through the official line.

Let

r=n−k,M>1,M∣gcd(n,k),

and work over a prime field K containing a proper subgroup H of order n, with an element λ

=0 satisfying −λ∈
/
H. Define

E
per
	​

(X)=X
r
=(X
M
)
r/M

and

E
aper
	​

(X)=X
r−1
(X+λ)=X
r
+λX
r−1
.

Both have degree r and are nonzero on H. The first is a quotient pullback. The second is not a polynomial in X
M
, because its nonzero X
r−1
 term has exponent not divisible by M.

Fix any noncodeword direction g∈K
H
. For i∈{per,aper}, interpolate the word E
i
	​

g by J
i
	​

∈K[X]
<n
	​

, and divide

J

	​

i
	​

R
i
	​

−B
i
	​

,degR
i
	​

<k,degB
i
	​

<r.

Then on H,

g=R
i
	​

−
E
i
	​

B
i
	​

	​

.

For any anchor f, put w
i
	​

=E
i
	​

f. The associated official residue datum induces the line

f−z
E
i
	​

B
i
	​

	​

=f+z(g−R
i
	​

),

which differs from f+zg only by the codeword zR
i
	​

. Therefore the two data have:

the same official bad slopes,
the same syndrome pencil (M
f
	​

,M
g
	​

),
the same corrected-reserve parameters,

but opposite statuses under the literal chosen-denominator periodicity test.

Hence the implication

AP
chosen denominator
source
	​

⟹AP
corr
	​

(M
f
	​

,M
g
	​

)

cannot be well-defined.

This cuts unary AP descent to an undecorated
U
 or undecorated syndrome pencil. The exact repair is one of:

Replace chosen-denominator periodicity by an intrinsic line-level predicate, such as existence of a quotient/action-rank representation of the codeword-gauge class [g]; or

Carry the source presentation as Gate B metadata.

The second option gives formal predicate transport but does not give rank escape: the same activity pencil can receive either presentation label.

COUNTERPACKET

No source-valid COUNTERPACKET is established.

The presentation-gauge pair is a ROUTE_CUT, not a counterpacket to the full theorem. An intrinsic quotient charge may correctly charge both presentations. It also does not produce a superpolynomial above-reserve residual numerator after all charges are paid.

No finite/model certificate is being promoted.

EXACT_NEW_WALL

After replacing source aperiodicity by an intrinsic, line-invariant predicate, the first missing implication is:

2. Prize relevance

This is an exact official-route source-adapter theorem in the native same-field multiplicative-domain setting. It is not merely a finite/model certificate.

It is not a prize proof because no polynomial residual numerator bound, complete charge ledger, protocol field transfer, or

5. Possible numerator reductions

Yes.

Quotient/periodic or hidden low-action-rank structure can charge an entire source line, but the predicate must be intrinsic.

Contained incidences are exactly M
g
	​

λ(T)=0 and contribute no official bad slope.

Multiple supports producing the same slope are deduplicated automatically.

Tangent supports may be separately charged; the adapter itself does not assume such a charge.

Full-support endpoint terms contribute at most one.

High-denominator branches cause no chart explosion; they use the same syndrome pencil.

Affine-color normalization causes no loss here because the slope map is the identity. Any alternative z↦αz+β must have α

=0, and every color class must be counted.

Field confinement can reduce the numerator to a proper subfield, but only through the exact field-confinement theorem.

6. Conversion to PROOF or COUNTERPACKET

PROOF requires the separator-or-charge theorem (8), the exact charged numerator, and the field test in (9).

COUNTERPACKET requires an above-reserve, intrinsically aperiodic official family with every charge paid and superpolynomial residual readout count. The denominator-presentation gauge pair is insufficient.
