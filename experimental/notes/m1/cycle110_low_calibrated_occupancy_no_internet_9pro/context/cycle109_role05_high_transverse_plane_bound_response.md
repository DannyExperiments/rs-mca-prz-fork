BANKABLE_LEMMA

1. Executive verdict and confidence

The HIGH branch has a canonical denominator-free cover by at most

σ≤n

same-field pivot charts. Thus the requested chart alternative holds with C=1, independently of k,σ,h, and the displayed or intrinsic denominator representation. The normalization retains its pivot tag and never changes the original slope z∈K
line
	​

.

The stronger claim that HIGH always has only n
O(1)
 distinct slopes is false without an occupancy/support-union charge or an additional AP/separator theorem. There are intrinsic t=σ+1 lines with full standard quotient-action rank for which one pivot chart contains superpolynomially many distinct slopes after same-slope collisions have already been deduplicated.

Consequently:

HIGH chart-count wall closed; HIGH chart-image wall still open.
	​

Confidence is high for the pivot-chart theorem and the one-chart overflow construction. Confidence is unknown for promotion through the unavailable formal AP
corr
	​

 and official charge predicates. This is not a prize proof and not an official counterpacket.

2. Exact theorem and route-cut statements

Let

F=K

	​

	​

with ∣D∣=n, r=n−k, reserve σ≥1, and

,0≤m<r,x∈D,

where the nonzero GRS column multipliers η

 are allowed. Let the syndrome line be

ℓ(z)=u+zv,u,v∈F
r


=0.

For T∈(
j
D
	​

), put

W
T
	​

=span
F
	​

{H(:,x):x∈T}.

A transverse exact-j witness is

u+zv∈W
T
	​

,v∈

W
T
	​

.
(2.1)

The endpoint-first partition is assumed, so this theorem concerns the affine interior.

Theorem A — HIGH catalecticant pivot atlas

For s=(s

	​

,…,s
r−1

)∈F
r

Cat

m+ℓ

,0≤m<σ,0≤ℓ≤j.

Write

A=Cat

(u),B=Cat
j
	​

(v).

For T∈(

), let

P

X

,p

	​

T,0
	​

,…,p

T
.

Then:

s∈W
T
	​

 if and only if

Cat
j
	​

(s)p
T
	​

=0.
(2.2)

The transverse incidence (2.1) is equivalent to

(A+zB)p
T
	​

=0,Bp
T
	​


=0.
(2.3)

Set

i(T)=min{m:(Bp
T
	​

)
m
	​


=0}

and normalize

p
	​

T
	​

=(Bp
T
	​

)
i(T)
−1
	​

p
T
	​

.

Then (z,
p
	​

T
	​

) belongs to the explicit pivot chart

X
i
	​

(u,v)=
⎩
⎨
⎧
	​

(z,p):
[p] is the locator of a j-subset of D,
(Bp)

z=−(Ap)

⎭
⎬
⎫
	​

.
(2.4)

After choosing one canonical uncharged witness T
z
	​

 for each distinct uncharged bad slope z, for example the lexicographically first one, the assignment

z⟼(i(T
z
	​

),z,
p
	​

T
z
	​

	​

)
(2.5)

is injective.

Therefore every uncharged HIGH slope lies in one of at most

σ≤n
(2.6)

tagged charts, and the normalized line parameter is the original

θ=z∈K
line
	​

.

No support-dependent affine transformation of z is used. The support-dependent normalization is only the projective locator normalization p
T
	​

↦
p
	​

T
	​

, and the pivot i remains in the tag.

This theorem is actually all-denominator: intrinsic t>σ is needed only to route the source object into HIGH, not to construct the atlas.

Exact occupancy alternative

Independently of the charts,

N
HIGH
	​

≤min{q
line
	​

,(
j
n
	​

)}.
(2.7)

Thus a numerically correct HIGH upper program has the conditional form

N
HIGH
	​

≤min{(
j
n
	​

),N
HIGH,paid
	​

+
i=0
∑
σ−1
	​

∣Z
i
	​

∣},
(2.8)

where Z
i
	​

⊆K
line
	​

 is the distinct original-slope image of the uncharged part of chart i.

The chart theorem controls the number of Z
i
	​

's. It does not yet control their cardinalities.

Theorem B — one-chart HIGH overflow

Fix an official rate ρ∈{1/2,1/4,1/8,1/16}, take k=ρn, and assume r=n−k≥3. Put

σ=1,t=2,h=1,j=r−1,N=(
r−1
n
	​

).

Let F=F
q
	​

 for an odd prime q>N, and let D⊂F be any n-point affine domain. There exist:

a primitive irreducible quadratic E∈F[X];

a nonzero B
num
	​

∈F[X]
<2
	​

;

a direction

g(x)=−
E(x)
B
num
	​

(x)
	​

;

an anchor word f;

such that:

the intrinsic denominator degree of g is exactly

τ(g)=2=σ+1;

its syndrome v=Hg
T
 obeys

v∈
/
W
T
	​

for every T∈(
r−1
D
	​

);
(2.9)

for every standard active quotient exponent 1≤M≤n<q+1,

d
M
	​

(E)=2,

so no low-action-rank quotient descent occurs;

the line f+zg has at least

1+N/q
N
	​

>
2
N
	​

(2.10)

distinct transverse bad slopes;

since σ=1, all those slopes lie in one pivot chart.

At fixed rate, N is exponential in n. Hence a single HIGH chart can have a superpolynomial slope image even after same-slope collisions have been removed and the standard denominator action-rank test is full.

This is a route cut to an unconditional polynomial slope cap. It is not an official counterpacket because the packet does not provide the formal repaired AP
corr
	​

, complete affine-color/internal-charge predicates, or an asymptotic family respecting the strict official field cap.

3. Proof
3.1 Locator–syndrome identity

Suppose first that s∈W
T
	​

. Then for suitable coefficients e
x
	​

,

s
m
	​

=
x∈T
∑
	​

e
x
	​

η
x
	​

x
m
.

Consequently, for 0≤m<σ,

(Cat
j
	​

(s)p
T
	​

)
m
	​

	​

=
ℓ=0
∑
j
	​

p
T,ℓ
	​

s
m+ℓ
	​

=
x∈T
∑
	​

e

	​

η

ℓ=0
∑

x∈T
∑
	​

e
x
	​

η
x
	​

x
m
P
T
	​

(x)
=0.
	​

Thus

W
T
	​

⊆ker(s↦Cat
j
	​

(s)p
T
	​

).

The latter linear map has rank σ. Indeed, since P
T
	​

 has degree j and nonzero leading coefficient, its σ shifted coefficient rows have distinct rightmost pivot positions

j, j+1, …, j+σ−1=r−1.

Its kernel therefore has dimension

r−σ=j.

The MDS property gives dimW
T
	​

=j, so the inclusion is equality. This proves (2.2).

3.2 Incidence and transversality

Applying (2.2) to u+zv gives

u+zv∈W
T
	​

⟺(A+zB)p
T
	​

=0.

Likewise,

v∈W
T
	​

⟺Bp
T
	​

=0.

Hence noncontainment is exactly the second condition in (2.3).

If Bp
T
	​


=0, choose its first nonzero coordinate i. Scaling p
T
	​

 so that this coordinate is 1 gives

(B
p
	​

T
	​

)
m
	​

=0(m<i),(B
p
	​

T
	​

)
i
	​

=1.

The i-th coordinate of

(A+zB)
p
	​

T
	​

=0

gives

z=−(A
p
	​

T
	​

)
i
	​

.

Substituting this into every other coordinate gives

(A
p
	​

T
	​

)
m
	​

−(A
p
	​

T
	​

)
i
	​

(B
p
	​

T
	​

)
m
	​

=0.

These are exactly the equations in (2.4).

There are only σ possible pivots. Charges can delete points from the charts but cannot increase the number of chart types.

3.3 Injectivity and same-slope collisions

A support may not be unique. That is irrelevant to the numerator.

For each distinct uncharged slope z, choose one canonical witness T
z
	​

. The chart record retains z itself and satisfies

z=−(A
p
	​

T
z
	​

	​

)
i(T
z
	​

)
	​

.

Thus two different slopes cannot have the same assigned chart record. Multiple supports producing the same z are discarded before counting.

This is not a support-multiplicity upper bound masquerading as a slope bound.

3.4 Maximal-denominator gauge freedom

The residue representation of a direction is nonunique. In particular:

a denominator may be padded;

at t=r, every word admits some denominator representation;

multiplying numerator and denominator by auxiliary factors changes the displayed residue coordinates;

a codeword gauge changes the rational presentation without changing the syndrome.

None of this changes v=Hg
T
, and therefore none changes

B=Cat
j
	​

(v),Bp
T
	​

,i(T),z=−(A
p
	​

T
	​

)
i
	​

.

The only denominator datum that must survive routing is the intrinsic minimum τ(g). Once the line is routed to HIGH using

τ(g)=σ+h>σ,

the atlas itself is denominator-free.

This also resolves the maximal-denominator case t=r: it creates no additional charts.

3.5 Residue-coordinate interpretation of ratio overflow

The banked HIGH residue normal form has, for each support S=D∖T,

α
S
	​

=π
h
	​

([L
S
	​

]
E
−1
	​

[I
S
	​

(w)]
E
	​

),δ
S
	​

=π
h
	​

([L
S
	​

]
E
−1
	​

[B
num
	​

]
E
	​

)

in a σ-dimensional quotient.

A transverse incidence is

α
S
	​

=zδ
S
	​

,δ
S
	​


=0.

Choosing the first nonzero coordinate of δ
S
	​

 produces the same σ-chart atlas and the ratio

z=
δ
S,i
	​

α
S,i
	​

	​

.

Normalizing δ
S,i
	​

=1 removes the division but does not control the image of z. The syndrome atlas shows that this image size is an invariant issue, not a residue-gauge artefact.

3.6 Construction of the one-chart overflow family

Let E be a primitive irreducible quadratic and write

A
E
	​

=F[X]/(E).

For each S∈(
k+1
D
	​

), let

L
S
	​

(X)=
x∈S
∏
	​

(X−x).

A direction g=−B
num
	​

/E agrees with a degree-<k polynomial G on S exactly when

EG+B
num
	​

vanishes on S. Its degree is at most k+1=∣S∣, so this happens exactly when

EG+B
num
	​

=cL
S
	​

for some c∈F. Reducing modulo E,

[B
num
	​

]
E
	​

∈F[L
S
	​

]
E
	​

.
(3.1)

Conversely, (3.1) gives

G=
E
cL
S
	​

−B
num
	​

	​

∈F[X]
<k
	​

.

Thus every support excludes one projective line in the two-dimensional space A
E
	​

. There are at most

N=(
k+1
n
	​

)=(
r−1
n
	​

)

such lines, while P(A
E
	​

)≅P
1
(F) has q+1>N points. Choose B
num
	​

 outside their union. This proves (2.9).

Intrinsic degree

Suppose g had a representation of degree t
′
<2:

−
E
B
num
	​

	​

=R−
E
′
B
′
	​

on D,

with degR<k, degE
′
=1, and degB
′
<1. Then

REE
′
−B
′
E+B
num
	​

E
′

vanishes on all n points of D and has degree at most k+2<n, since r≥3. It is therefore the zero polynomial. Reducing modulo E gives

B
num
	​

E
′
≡0(modE).

Because E is irreducible and 0

=B
num
	​

 has smaller degree, this forces E∣E
′
, impossible. Hence τ(g)=2.

Quotient action rank

Let α be a primitive root of E, so α has order q
2
−1. For 1≤M≤n<q+1,

α
M
∈F⟺q+1∣M,

which cannot happen. Hence the minimal polynomial of α
M
 has degree 2, so d
M
	​

(E)=2.

Distinct-slope lower bound

For a uniformly random syndrome anchor u∈F
r
, fix z∈F and define

X
z
	​

(u)=#{T∈(
r−1
D
	​

):u+zv∈W
T
	​

}.

Each W
T
	​

 is a hyperplane, so

EX
z
	​

=
q
N
	​

=:λ.

Distinct T,T
′
 give distinct hyperplanes. Otherwise their union would contain r dependent RS columns, contradicting MDS. Their intersection has codimension 2, so

Pr[u+zv∈W
T
	​

∩W
T
′
	​

]=q
−2
.

Therefore

EX
z
2
	​

=
q
N
	​

+
q
2
N(N−1)
	​

<λ+λ
2
.

The second-moment inequality gives

Pr[X
z
	​

>0]≥
EX
z
2
	​

(EX
z
	​

)
2
	​

>
1+λ
λ
	​

.

Summing over z∈F, some anchor u has more than

q
1+λ
λ
	​

=
1+N/q
N
	​

occupied slopes. Every incidence is transverse by construction, so every occupied slope is MCA-bad. Since q>N, this is greater than N/2.

The same calculation works for any selected support subfamily A: with M=∣A∣, some anchor has at least

1+M/q
M
	​

(3.2)

distinct slopes witnessed inside A. Thus deleting literal periodic supports does not restore a polynomial slope cap unless the deletion leaves only polynomially many eligible support hyperplanes, or a separate slope-level charge fires.

3.7 Why this is not a prize counterpacket

If one chooses

q>2
128
N,

then the exact support-union cap already gives

N
off
	​

≤N≤⌊
2
128
q
	​

⌋.

So the numerator can be exponential in n and still be prize-safe. Polynomial numerator size is not itself the prize invariant.

Moreover, a growing choice q>N eventually violates the strict official field cap q
line
	​

<2
256
. The construction also has not been checked against the absent formal AP
corr
	​

, affine-color charge, or complete official domain/normalization registry.

4. Verification requirements

The HIGH atlas can be banked after the following checks.

Algebraic source checks

Verify that the official endpoint-first interior parity-check coordinates are GRS-equivalent to the catalecticant form used above.

For projective domains, either keep the endpoint branch separate or replace P
T
	​

(X) by the homogeneous binary locator and verify the corresponding contraction identity.

Verify the banked exact-j padding convention is used only for σ≥1.

Verify that the source routing certifies intrinsic

τ(g)=σ+h>σ;

displayed denominator degree is insufficient.

Exact chart checker

A checker cycle109_high_pivot_atlas_v1 should consume:

the complete field ledger and K

	​

It must then be combined, without double counting, with LOW, BALANCED, endpoint, tangent, quotient, contained, field, color, and internal charges. The checker must verify

5. Next exact lemma or counterpacket construction

The first missing theorem is:

L-CYCLE109-HIGH-SUPPORT-CAP-OR-PIVOT-ELIMINANT-CHARGE
	​

Exact statement

For every official HIGH line with intrinsic τ(g)>σ, after the endpoint-first partition:

either the support-union cap

is entered as an official paid upper term and fits its allocated q

	​

;

or failure is assigned to an explicitly named quotient/action-rank, contained, tangent/common-envelope, endpoint, field-confinement, affine-color, internal-value, or normalization charge with an exact distinct-slope cap.

The source implication still to be proved is exactly

	​

AP
corr
	​

+τ(g)>σ+support cap not numerically sufficient
+no official HIGH charge
⟹the eliminant bound (4.2) on every nonempty pivot chart.
	​

(5.1)

A counterpacket would require a growing official family satisfying every hypothesis on the left of (5.1), with some pivot-chart image—or equivalently the minimum possible nonzero univariate eliminant degree—superpolynomial, and with the resulting distinct slopes exceeding the exact remaining T
line
	​

 budget.

6. Self-audit
1. What exact implication did I prove, and what exact implication did I not prove?

Proved:

z∈Bad
HIGH,uncharged
	​

⟹z injects into one of σ≤n explicit catalecticant pivot charts.

The original slope remains in K
line
	​

, the pivot tag is retained, and maximal-denominator gauge does not affect the chart.

Also proved that one such chart can contain superpolynomially many distinct slopes in an intrinsic t=σ+1 family with full standard quotient-action rank.

Not proved:

AP
corr
	​

⟹∣Z
i
	​

∣≤n
O(1)
,

the official charge partition, or

N
off
	​

≤⌊q
line
	​

/2
128
⌋.
2. Is the result official-prize-relevant, or only finite/model/research?

The pivot atlas is an official-prize-relevant structural lemma: it uses the actual syndrome line and actual slopes in K
line
	​

, not a Cycle84 model.

The overflow family is a genuine growing RS/MCA construction and route cut, but not an official counterpacket because AP
corr
	​

, the full charge registry, and the strict official field profile have not been verified.

3. What is the first line in the reduction chain where the theorem could fail?

After the endpoint-first source adapter and intrinsic HIGH routing, the algebraic reduction to the pivot atlas is exact.

The first unproved line is precisely (5.1):

AP
corr
	​

+no charge+support cap insufficient⟹bounded-degree pivot eliminant.

For promotion of the overflow family, the first missing line is evaluation of the formal source AP
corr
	​

 and official charge predicates.

4. Are the fields and 2
−128
 target being used correctly?

Yes.

The locator charts, slopes, pivots, and eliminants are over K
line
	​

.

H originates over K
code
	​

 and is scalar-extended through an explicit embedding into K
line
	​

.

q
gen
	​

 may pay only a generated-field reserve or entropy inequality, followed by an explicit transfer.

q
chal
	​

 is unused.

The final MCA target is

⌊q
line
	​

/2
128
⌋.

A superpolynomial numerator can still be safe when q
line
	​

 is correspondingly larger; no polynomial numerator claim is substituted for the actual probability inequality.

5. Could the listed mechanisms reduce the numerator?

Yes, but only explicitly:

Quotient/periodic: can delete chart points. The overflow construction has full standard d
M
	​

(E), but the complete official quotient predicate remains unaudited.

Contained: exactly Bp
T
	​

=0; excluded from every pivot chart.

Same-slope collisions: can reduce support multiplicity, but the atlas and lower bound count occupied z's only.

Tangent/common envelope: can be paid separately. In the overflow construction v lies in no proper column span generated by at most r−1 columns, but the exact official tangent registry must still be checked.

Endpoint: absent in the affine construction and separated before the atlas.

Field confinement: can reduce an image to a proper subfield. The prime-field overflow construction has no proper subfield.

Affine-color normalization: a bijective affine map of K

 does not reduce cardinality. A genuine color-fiber restriction can, but its tag and exact fiber cap must be retained.

6. What would convert this result into PROOF or COUNTERPACKET?

For PROOF: prove (5.1), provide exact R
i
	​

 degree caps, complete the charge partition, and verify the whole numerator program against ⌊q
line
	​

/2
128
⌋.

For COUNTERPACKET: instantiate the one-chart overflow mechanism—or another HIGH family—inside the strict official field/domain profile, verify source AP
corr
	​

, eliminate every official charge, and prove that the distinct original slopes exceed the exact remaining line-field budget.
