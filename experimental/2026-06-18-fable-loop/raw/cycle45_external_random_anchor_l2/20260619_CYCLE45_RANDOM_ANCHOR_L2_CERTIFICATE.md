# Cycle 45 Random-Anchor L2 / Reserve-Landing Certificate

Ledger:

\[
q_{\rm gen}=p,\quad B=\mathbf F_p,\quad F=\mathbf F_{p^2},\quad
q_{\rm line}=|F|=p^2,\quad q_{\rm chal}\text{ unused},\quad D=\mathbf F_p.
\]

Let `q=q_line=p^2`, let `E in F[X]` have degree `t` and be nonzero on `D`,
let `A=F[X]/E`, let `b=[Bnum]_E != 0`, and fix `j`, `a=p-j` with
`t<=a`. For each `j`-subset `T`, write `S_T=D\T` and

\[
R_T(w)=\rho_w(T)=[\operatorname{interp}_{S_T}(w)]_E\in A.
\]

## BANKABLE_LEMMA: exact pair-rank law

For `T,T'`, put

\[
r=|T\setminus T'|=|T'\setminus T|,
\qquad C=S_T\cap S_{T'}.
\]

Then the image of the `F`-linear map

\[
w\longmapsto (R_T(w),R_{T'}(w))
\]

is exactly

\[
\{(u,v)\in A^2:u-v\in V_C\},\qquad
V_C=[L_C F[X]_{<r}]_E,
\]

and

\[
\dim_F V_C=\min(t,r),\qquad
\operatorname{rank}_F(R_T,R_{T'})=t+\min(t,r).
\]

Proof: the two interpolation polynomials have degree `<a`; their difference
vanishes on `C`, hence equals `L_C R` with `deg R<r`. Conversely every such
difference is realized by compatible values on `S_T union S_T'`. Since `E`
has no root in `C`, `L_C` is a unit modulo `E`; the residues of polynomials
of degree `<r` have dimension `min(t,r)`.

## PROOF: exact random-anchor moments

Take `w` uniformly from `F^D`. Let

\[
\nu_w(z)=\#\{T:|T|=j,\ R_T(w)=zb\},\qquad
N=\binom pj,\qquad \lambda=N/q^t.
\]

For every `z in F`,

\[
\mathbf E\nu_w(z)=\lambda.
\]

For fixed `T`, the number of `T'` at exchange distance `r` is

\[
K_r=\binom jr\binom ar.
\]

The pair-rank law gives the exact formula

\[
\mathbf E\nu_w(z)^2
=N\sum_{r=0}^{\min(j,a)}K_r q^{-t-\min(t,r)}.
\]

Set

\[
C_*=\sum_{r\ge0}\frac{4^{-r}}{(r!)^2}<e^{1/4}.
\]

Because `ja<=p^2/4=q/4`,

\[
\sum_r K_rq^{-r}\le C_*.
\]

Splitting at `r=t` yields

\[
\operatorname{Var}(\nu_w(z))\le C_*\lambda.
\]

Consequently, for

\[
\Phi(w)=\sum_{z\in F}(\nu_w(z)-\lambda)^2,
\]

\[
\mathbf E\Phi(w)\le C_*q\lambda.
\]

Hence some deterministic anchor `w` satisfies

\[
\Phi(w)\le C_*q\lambda.
\]

It can be selected by the method of conditional expectations, fixing the
`p` coordinates of `w` one at a time.

Let

\[
L=\#\operatorname{Land}=\sum_z\nu_w(z),\qquad
M_2=\sum_z\nu_w(z)^2,
\qquad s=\sqrt{C_*/\lambda}.
\]

Cauchy--Schwarz gives

\[
|L-q\lambda|\le q\lambda s,
\]

and expansion around the mean gives

\[
M_2\le q\lambda^2(1+s)^2.
\]

Therefore, whenever `lambda -> infinity`,

\[
M_2\le\left(\frac{1+s}{1-s}\right)^2\frac{L^2}{q}
=(1+O(\lambda^{-1/2}))\frac{L^2}{q}.
\]

This is stronger than the Cycle 44 target

\[
M_2\le L+(1+o(1))L^2/q_{\rm line}.
\]

If `lambda>C_*q`, then every slope occurs: otherwise a missing slope alone
would contribute `lambda^2>C_*q lambda` to `Phi`. Thus

\[
\#\{z:\nu_w(z)>0\}=q_{\rm line}.
\]

## PROOF: reserve-scale specialization

Fix `0<rho<1` and

\[
0<C<\tfrac12 H_2(\rho).
\]

For each sufficiently large prime `p`, set

\[
t=\left\lfloor \frac{Cp}{\log_2p}\right\rfloor,
\qquad k=\lfloor\rho p\rfloor,
\qquad a=k+t,
\qquad j=p-a.
\]

Choose `alpha in F_{p^2}\F_p`,

\[
E=X^t-\alpha,\qquad Bnum=1,
\]

and choose the anchor by the preceding conditional-expectation argument.
Then `E(d)!=0` for every `d in F_p`, since `d^t in F_p` but `alpha notin
F_p`. Also `t<p`, so `E` is squarefree, and `E` is coprime to its Frobenius
conjugate.

Stirling gives

\[
\log_2\lambda
=\log_2\binom pj-2t\log_2p
=(H_2(\rho)-2C+o(1))p.
\]

Hence `lambda/q_line -> infinity`, and every one of the `p^2` slopes lands.

For a landing `T`, put `S=D\T` and `Q_z=I_S`. Then

\[
\deg Q_z<a=k+t,\qquad Q_z\equiv z\pmod E,
\qquad Q_z=w\text{ on }S.
\]

Noncontainment is automatic: if `G in F[X]_{<k}` agreed with `-1/E` on
`S`, then `EG+1` would have degree `<k+t=|S|` and `|S|` roots, so would be
the zero polynomial, impossible for nonconstant `E`. Thus every landing is a
source-valid noncontained witness.

Equivalently, for the line

\[
f=w/E,\qquad g=-1/E,
\]

all `p^2` parameters are support-wise MCA-bad at radius

\[
\delta_p=1-\frac{k+t}{p}
=1-\rho-\frac{C}{\log_2p}+o(1/\log p).
\]

This is a restricted extension-field reserve-scale result. It is not a
generated-field theorem and does not assert the positive corrected-reserve
half above the entropy threshold.

## ROUTE_CUT: no uniform-in-anchor L2 theorem

The L2 statement is false as a uniform assertion over all source-valid anchors. Take an anchor
supported at one point `d0`. Every `T` containing `d0` has `I_{D\T}=0`, hence
lands at slope `0`. Therefore

\[
\nu(0)\ge\binom{p-1}{j-1}=\frac jp\binom pj
\ge \frac jp\#\operatorname{Land}.
\]

For `j=Theta(p)` this meets the Cycle 44 high-multiplicity falsifier by a
constant factor. Thus the correct theorem is existential/averaged over the
anchor, exactly as required by the packing maximum; it cannot be uniform over
all residue-line data.

## AUDIT: correction to the stated one-fiber falsifier threshold

With `q_line=p^2`, the dense-regime L2 scale is

\[
M_2\asymp L^2/p^2,
\]

so L2 permits a largest fiber of order `L/p`. A single-fiber lower bound

\[
\max_z\nu(z)\ge L/p^{1+\epsilon}
\]

is therefore **not** a falsifier: it is smaller than the permitted RMS scale.
A sufficient one-fiber falsifier is instead

\[
\max_z\nu(z)\gg L/p,
\]

for example `max nu >= L/p^(1-epsilon)`. Nor can a lower bound on the maximum
fiber by itself force a small image; one needs a second-moment excess or a
statement that `1-o(1)` of the landing mass is carried by `o(q_line)` slopes.
The one-point anchor above gives the much stronger `max nu >= c L`, so it is a
genuine uniform-L2 falsifier despite the defect in the packet's general
criterion.
