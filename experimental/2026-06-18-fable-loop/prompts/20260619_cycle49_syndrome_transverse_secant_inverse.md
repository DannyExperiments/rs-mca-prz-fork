# Cycle 49 Prompt: Syndrome Transverse-Secant Inverse Or Counterpacket

You are auditing the RS-MCA / Proximity Prize route after Cycle 47 and Cycle 48.
Answer as an open-math theorem worker. Use the labels `PROOF`,
`COUNTERPACKET`, `BANKABLE_LEMMA`, `ROUTE_CUT`, and `EXACT_NEW_WALL`
literally. Do not promote restricted or conditional results to a prize-level
claim.

## Context

Cycle 47 banked the lower/failure branch as a strong theorem candidate. For an
arbitrary distinct-point domain `D subset F_Q`, support size `a=k+t`, and
denominator `E` of degree `t` with no roots on `D`, the random-anchor pair-rank
law is

```text
rank_F(w -> (R_S(w),R_S'(w))) = t + min(t, |S\S'|).
```

The Bessel shell is

```text
J <= I_0(2 sqrt(aj/Q)) <= exp(2 sqrt(aj/Q)),
```

and there is an anchor with missed slopes at most `QJ/lambda`, where

```text
lambda = binom(n,k+t)/Q^t.
```

For smooth multiplicative `L subset F^*`, the lower branch takes

```text
E=X^t, B=1, f=w/E, g=-1/E.
```

Thus, asymptotically, the failure side reaches the strict entropy range
`c < H_2(rho)` when `t=(c+o(1)) n/log_2 Q` and `log_2 Q=o(n)`.

Cycle 48 did **not** prove the matching upper theorem. It produced a route cut:
literal quotient-pullback aperiodicity is too narrow. Quotient-component
denominators with

```text
E | m(X^M)
```

and fixed-defect quotient-anchor packets can produce large reduced balanced
clouds above entropy even when `E` is not syntactically `E_0(X^M)`.

The correct quotient invariant is, for every quotient scale `M`,

```text
xi_M = [X^M]_E,
d_M(E) = deg minpoly_F(xi_M).
```

Low `d_M(E)` marks a quotient-component packet; the extreme `d_M(E)=1` is the
punctured-fiber coequalizer obstruction.

Cycle 48 also banked several upper-side reductions:

1. **Support-syndrome all-t normal form.** Every residue-line witness, for every
   denominator degree `1 <= t <= n-k`, is a collinearity condition in a
   support-dependent syndrome space of dimension exactly `sigma`.
2. **Balanced noncontainment.** In the exact balanced reduced stratum
   `a=k+t`, `B != 0` makes every witness automatically noncontained.
3. **Tangent cap.** A fixed `k`-point tangent core contributes at most `j+1`
   slopes.
4. **Residual slack.** For `t < sigma`, slopes inject into an actual
   `RS[k+t]` list with residual slack `sigma-t`, but that reduction is too weak
   near `t=sigma`.
5. **High denominator.** For `t > sigma`, the object becomes a thick affine
   residue-plane incidence and needs a denominator-compression or affine-tube
   inverse theorem.
6. **Locator-scroll circuit.** In the balanced reduced stratum, complement
   locators `p_z=Lambda_{T_z}` satisfy a pencil equation

```text
C_w(p_z) = z D_B(p_z),
C_w(p)=[rem_ML(W p)]_E,
D_B(p)=[B p]_E.
```

If the locator span does not meet `E F[X]_{<=j-t}`, then there are at most
`j+1` slopes. Every cloud larger than `j+1` contains an `E`-resonant circuit

```text
sum c_i p_i = 0,
sum c_i z_i p_i = E H != 0,
sum c_i P_i p_i = -B H.
```

7. **Finite correction.** Let `N=binom(n,k+t)`. A finite upper theorem must
   include the random line-occupancy scale

```text
R_line = ceil(N / Q^(t-1)).
```

At `Q^t=N`, this is `R_line=Q`, so a bare `n^{1+o(1)}` upper bound immediately
after entropy equality is not the right finite statement.

## Exact Target

Work in the syndrome formulation.

Let `C=RS[F,L,k]`, `|L|=n`, `r=n-k`, and let

```text
syn:F^L -> F^r
```

be a syndrome map. For `x in L`, let `h_x=syn(e_x)`. For a complement
`T subset L`, `|T|=j`, define

```text
W_T = span{h_x : x in T}.
```

Define the transverse secant-line packing number

```text
Pi_j(C) =
max_{u,v in F^r}
#{ z in F :
   exists T in binom(L,j) with u+zv in W_T and v notin W_T }.
```

The exact normal form is

```text
epsilon_mca(C, 1-(k+sigma)/n) = Pi_j(C)/|F|.
```

The current main wall is:

```text
W-MCA-SYNDROME-TRANSVERSE-SECANT-ENTROPY-INVERSE
```

Above corrected entropy and quotient reserve, prove that a syndrome line with
more than `R_line + A_theta(n)` transverse intersections must descend through a
proper quotient-component packet, a fixed-defect quotient-anchor packet, or an
explicitly bounded tangent/common-envelope template.

Equivalently, prove or refute the labelled subspace-design form:

```text
W_{E,B}=F^L/(E RS[F,L,k] + F B).
```

For each `a`-support `S`, project the residue map modulo the slope line. A
support succeeds for the anchor class if the projected residue vanishes, and on
that kernel a unique label `z_S` is determined up to common translation. Classify
support-family systems whose label projection contains more than
`R_line + A_theta(n)` distinct labels.

Allowed outputs:

1. `PROOF`: a source-valid proof of the inverse theorem.
2. `COUNTERPACKET`: a source-valid above-entropy construction not covered by
   quotient-component, fixed-defect quotient-anchor, tangent/common-envelope,
   lower-denominator, same-witness, or residual-list templates.
3. `BANKABLE_LEMMA`: a rigorous reduction, finite certificate, or new exact
   sublemma that materially shrinks the wall.
4. `ROUTE_CUT`: a precise false route or hypothesis that must be removed.
5. `EXACT_NEW_WALL`: the next smaller theorem-sized missing object.

## Required Checks

- Treat `t<sigma`, `t=sigma`, and `t>sigma` explicitly, or explain why the
  syndrome formulation subsumes them.
- Do not use raw feasible support fibers as list bounds; use actual lists,
  full agreement supports, or a canonical selected-support injection.
- Do not assume quotient aperiodicity means only `E=E_0(X^M)`. Use the
  quotient-action rank `d_M(E)`.
- Separate finite target accounting from asymptotic notation. If your theorem
  uses `n^{1+o(1)}`, state what finite numerator replaces it.
- If you give a counterpacket, verify reducedness, denominator minimality,
  noncontainment, distinct slopes, exact support size or overagreement handling,
  smooth/generated-field hypotheses, and quotient/template status.
