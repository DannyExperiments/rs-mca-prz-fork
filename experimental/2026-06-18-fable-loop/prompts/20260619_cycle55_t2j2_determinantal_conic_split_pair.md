# Cycle 55 Prompt: t=2, j=2 Determinantal Conic Split-Pair Count

You are a theorem worker for the RS-MCA / Proximity Prize project.

Read the project source and recent loop material first, especially the Cycle 53
and Cycle 54 audits. Preserve the labels `PROOF`, `COUNTERPACKET`,
`BANKABLE_LEMMA`, `ROUTE_CUT`, and `EXACT_NEW_WALL` literally.

## Banked State

Cycle 53 reduced the per-line positive/safe-side MCA upper wall to the signed
slope-summed character estimate

```text
R(u,v)=binomial(n,j)/Q^(t-1)-Q*K0_split+Err.
```

Cycle 54 specialized to `t=2` and eliminated the slope variable. For

```text
a(T)=H(u)ell_T,
b(T)=H(v)ell_T,
```

the transverse landing count is exactly

```text
R(u,v)=#{T split : D(T)=0, b(T)!=0},
D(T)=a_0(T)b_1(T)-a_1(T)b_0(T).
```

Expanding in locator coefficients:

```text
D(T)=sum_{l,l'=0}^{j} kappa_{l,l'} (ell_T)_l (ell_T)_{l'},
kappa_{l,l'}=u_l v_{l'+1}-u_{l+1}v_{l'}.
```

Cycle 54 proved the `j=1` subcase:

```text
R(u,v)<=2=O(j).
```

The next smallest open case is `t=2,j=2`.

## Active Wall

```text
W-MCA-T2J2-DETERMINANTAL-CONIC-SPLIT-PAIR-COUNT
```

Let `T={s,s'}` with `s,s' in L`, `s != s'`. Then

```text
ell_T=(e_2,-e_1,1),
e_1=s+s',
e_2=ss'.
```

The equation `D(T)=0` is one conic in `(e_1,e_2)`:

```text
D(s+s',ss')=0.
```

Prove or refute the bound

```text
#{ {s,s'} subset L : D(s+s',ss')=0, b(T)!=0 }
<= ceil(binomial(n,2)/Q)+O(1),
```

after removing tangent/core and quotient/imprimitive packets.

## Hypotheses To Respect

- `L=mu_n` or a smooth multiplicative Reed-Solomon evaluation domain.
- `F` has size `Q`; in the extension ledger keep `Q=q_line` distinct from
  generated/base-field quantities.
- The pencil `(u,v)` is transverse; contained/core/tangent templates are
  removed.
- The `t=2` balanced hypotheses hold.
- Proper quotient-action-rank defects are removed. In particular, low
  `d_M(E)=deg minpoly([X^M]_E)` and `mu_M`-coset-union families should be
  excluded or charged separately.
- Locators are monic, squarefree, and fully `L`-split.

## Required Output Options

Return one of:

1. `PROOF`: a rigorous `t=2,j=2` conic split-pair count proving
   `R<=ceil(binomial(n,2)/Q)+O(1)` under the stated hypotheses.
2. `COUNTERPACKET`: a source-valid `t=2,j=2`, balanced, transverse,
   quotient-separated, aperiodic family with excess
   `omega(1)` beyond the random baseline. It must explain why it is not
   tangent/core, not quotient-action-rank, not same-witness, and not hidden
   imprimitive.
3. `BANKABLE_LEMMA / EXACT_NEW_WALL`: a strict reduction of the `j=2` conic
   count to a smaller exact theorem.
4. `ROUTE_CUT`: a precise reason the `t=2,j=2` conic formulation is malformed
   or missing an essential source hypothesis.

## Specific Questions

- Can the conic condition in `(e_1,e_2)` be transformed into a curve equation
  in `(s,s') in mu_n x mu_n` with a Weil/Stepanov bound?
- Does quotient separation correspond exactly to excluding components where
  `s'/s` lies in a proper small subgroup or where the conic becomes a quotient
  pullback through `X^M`?
- Classify degenerate conics: split lines, tangent-to-the-Vieta-discriminant,
  vertical/horizontal forms, and quotient-compatible forms. Which are already
  tangent/core or quotient packets?
- If the proof needs a character-sum estimate, state the exact sum and the
  required nondegeneracy condition.
- If a counterpacket exists, give explicit growing parameters and a source
  validity check.

## Do Not Do

- Do not use L2 anticollision as an upper bound.
- Do not use free-root monodromy or a `1/j` totally-split density shortcut.
- Do not count raw arbitrary locator fibers as actual lists.
- Do not ignore quotient-component packets or low `d_M(E)`.
- Do not promote this to a final prize solve.
