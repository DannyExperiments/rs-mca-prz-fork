# Agents Log

This file is the working ledger for agent-created material in `experimental/`.
Use it to record every new note, script, scan, formalization stub, or audit before
the material is promoted into `tex/` or `scripts/`.

The log is not a proof-status authority. It is a coordination record: what was
added, why it might matter, and what a human or later agent should check next.
Keep entries concise and link to the relevant files.

## Entry Format

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD - Short title

- **Agent/model:** Name the agent or model, for example `GPT-5.5 Pro`,
  `Claude Fable 5`, or `Codex`.

  or `scripts/`.
- **Status:** PROVED / CONDITIONAL / CONJECTURAL / EXPERIMENTAL / AUDIT /
  COUNTEREXAMPLE.
- **What is being added:** State the claim, note, scan, script, or certificate
  in one or two sentences.
- **How it is useful:** Say which paper, theorem, problem, ledger, or toy case
  the material supports.
- **What to do next:** Give the next verification, cleanup, proof step,
  experiment, or promotion decision.

## Entries

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 63 block-trade Round 2 packet

- **Agent/model:** Codex, following Cycle 62 Round 1 audit.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle63_block_trade_round2_packet/`
  and `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROMPT PACKET / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** A 9-worker prompt packet for the repaired
  scalar-list route after Role 04 cut the one-atom `Q_per` local-limit
  theorem. The packet centers on
  `L-MODEL-GJ-MAXIMAL-BLOCK-TRADE-CHARGE` and
  `W-LIST-MODEL-GJ-NEAR-SPLIT-COLLISION-CLASS-MASS`.
- **How it is useful:** Converts the Cycle 62 counterpacket into a focused
  block-trade repair round: formalize the counterpacket, prove block collapse,
  define canonical maximal `(K,D)` assignment, prove/kill overlap
  non-double-counting, and keep finite-checker / red-team / MCA-transfer
  lanes alive.
- **What to do next:** Upload
  `/Users/danielcabezas/20260620_cycle63_block_trade_round2_context.zip` to
  each worker, paste `COMMON_PROMPT.md`, then append one role prompt.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 62 Round 1 returns banked and audited

- **Agent/model:** External 5.5/5.6 Pro theorem-worker returns, banked and
  audited by Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle62_round1_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle62_round1_audit.md`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / BANKABLE_LEMMA / COUNTERPACKET / ROUTE_CUT /
  CONDITIONAL.
- **What is being added:** Raw Round 1 returns and verifier artifacts for the
  scalar-apolar execution packet. Roles 01 and 02 support the scalar apolar
  CI/GJ algebraic route; Role 04 cuts the declared one-atom `Q_per`
  local-limit route with an official-scale counterpacket; Role 05 repairs the
  `t=1` MCA color object by thickening the modulus; Roles 07 and 08 verify
  guard packets; Role 09 cuts right-factor-only two-block overlap rigidity.
- **How it is useful:** Moves the central scalar-list wall from
  `W-LIST-MODEL-GJ-QUOTIENT-CONDITIONED-LOCAL-LIMIT` to the sharper
  configuration/block-trade wall
  `L-MODEL-GJ-MAXIMAL-BLOCK-TRADE-CHARGE`.
- **What to do next:** Prepare a Round 2 packet around maximal `(K,D)`
  block-plus-defect assignment, finite overlap/non-double-counting, and the
  near-split collision-class-mass wall, while implementing the finite frontier
  checker and auditing the Role 01/02 algebra.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 62 scalar apolar Round 1 packet

- **Agent/model:** Codex, following the Cycle 61 Master Referee plan.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle62_scalar_apolar_round1_packet/`
  and `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROMPT PACKET / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** A 9-worker theorem prompt packet centered on the
  scalar-list apolar complete-intersection route, with `t=1` MCA
  generalized-Jacobian color as backup and finite checker / packet verifier
  lanes as guards.
- **How it is useful:** Converts the Master Referee decision into executable
  first-round prompts. The central wall is `L-LIST-MINIMAL-CI-GJ-FIBER`;
  nearby lanes prove the all-layer CI foundation, attack the model local
  limit, hunt counterpackets, and verify finite/frontier claims.
- **What to do next:** Upload
  `/Users/danielcabezas/20260620_cycle62_scalar_apolar_round1_context.zip`
  to each worker, paste `COMMON_PROMPT.md`, then append one role prompt.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 61 master referee plan banked locally

- **Agent/model:** 5.5 Pro Master Planner / Referee, banked by Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle61_master_referee_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle61_master_referee_audit.md`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / PLAN / CONDITIONAL.
- **What is being added:** The single master-referee answer that adjudicates
  the nine Cycle 61 planning responses. It selects the scalar-list apolar
  complete-intersection route as primary, with the `t=1` MCA
  generalized-Jacobian support-plus-color route as backup.
- **How it is useful:** Cuts the broad registry-first direction and turns the
  next proof round into a falsifiable route test around
  `L-LIST-MINIMAL-CI-GJ-FIBER`, the model generalized-Jacobian local limit,
  and a parallel finite frontier checker.
- **What to do next:** Prepare a targeted 9-instance round from the referee
  allocation, preserving the finite-checker and packet-verification lanes as
  route guards.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 61 planning synthesis and master referee packet

- **Agent/model:** Codex synthesizing nine external planning lanes.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle61_planning_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle61_planning_synthesis.md`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/cycle61_master_referee_packet/`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / PLAN / CONDITIONAL.
- **What is being added:** Raw preservation of the nine Cycle 61 planning
  answers, a consensus/conflict/actionability synthesis, and a
  master-referee prompt asking one final planning model to choose a primary
  route, cut distractions, and output a two-round execution plan.
- **How it is useful:** Converts the planning round into a decision problem:
  verify Lattes/split-rational registry first, prove support-overlap first,
  attack the `t=1` apolar/generalized-Jacobian base case, attack scalar
  list circuits, or build the finite checker first.
- **What to do next:** Send
  `/Users/danielcabezas/20260620_cycle61_master_referee_context.zip` plus
  `MASTER_REFEREE_PROMPT.md` to one strong 5.5 Pro master-referee instance,
  then bank its route decision before launching another proof round.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 61 planning packet

- **Agent/model:** Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle61_planning_packet/`
  and `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / EXPERIMENTAL.
- **What is being added:** A planning-only prompt packet for strong
  theorem-worker instances, including common instructions, current route
  state, context read order, and nine role prompts covering executive route
  planning, MCA safe-side architecture, split-rational/Lattes registry,
  primitive JR occupancy, scalar list circuits, counterpacket kill tests,
  finite ledgers, formalization, and meta-referee review.
- **How it is useful:** Tests whether 5.5-style planning strength can improve
  the overall solve route after Cycle 60 expanded the quotient and primitive
  container ledgers. The packet asks for dependency DAGs, theorem packages,
  kill tests, and next-prompt allocation rather than another direct proof
  attempt.
- **What to do next:** Run the nine-role planning round with
  `/Users/danielcabezas/20260620_cycle61_planning_context.zip`, then bank the
  returned plans and synthesize a route-board update before launching another
  theorem-proving round.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 60 find-the-theorem audit

- **Agent/model:** Codex auditing nine external theorem-worker lanes.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle60_find_the_theorem_audit.md`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/cycle60_find_the_theorem_raw/`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / COUNTEREXAMPLE / CONDITIONAL / EXPERIMENTAL, with
  BANKABLE_LEMMA, ROUTE_CUT, and EXACT_NEW_WALL subresults.
- **What is being added:** Raw preservation and a compact audit of the Cycle
  60 responses. The round expands the quotient ledger to include genus-one
  Lattes/isogeny packets, cuts a point-fiber-only primitive JR route via
  divisor-norm/configuration characters, and banks support-counting reductions
  for QAR, hereditary MDS-3-core extraction, the `t=1` apolar normal form, and
  scalar full-support circuit transversals.
- **How it is useful:** Refines the M1/MCA and scalar-list safe-side walls from
  broad denominator classifiers into support-theoretic split-rational,
  Lattes, configuration-character, envelope, and primitive occupancy
  containers. It also identifies arithmetic verification tasks for the
  proposed Lattes finite packets before promotion.
- **What to do next:** Verify the Lattes degree-31 and degree-113 arithmetic,
  then attack `W-SRQ-GENUS-0/1-MONODROMY-CONTAINER`,
  `W-JR-CORANK-ONE-DIVISOR-NORM-CHARACTER-TRICHOTOMY`,
  `W-JR-T1-PRIMITIVE-APOLAR-SPLIT-NUMERATOR-INVERSE`, and
  `W-LIST-LOW-ARITY-SPLIT-DENOMINATOR-CIRCUIT-COVER`.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 59 5.5/5.6 route-repair audit

- **Agent/model:** Codex auditing nine external 5.5/5.6 theorem-worker lanes.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle59_5p6_route_repair_audit.md`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/cycle59_5p6_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/cycle59_homerun_packet/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/cycle60_find_the_theorem_packet/`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / EXPERIMENTAL, with COUNTERPACKET and BANKABLE_LEMMA
  subresults.
- **What is being added:** A conservative synthesis of the Cycle 59
  theorem-worker responses, raw response preservation with checksums, and a
  follow-up prompt packet targeting the corrected finite container theorem.
- **How it is useful:** Expands the quotient ledger from monomial
  `X -> X^M` action rank to projective/split-rational quotient action rank,
  banks the exact jet-residue bridge for `t < sigma`, cuts pure
  Kronecker-section extraction and high-denominator compression shortcuts, and
  sharpens the MCA wall to a finite canonical hereditary affine-secant
  container theorem.
- **What to do next:** Attack
  `W-MCA-PROJECTIVE-SPLIT-RATIONAL-ACTION-RANK-INVERSE`,
  `W-MCA-QAR-FIXED-DEFECT-COVER`, and the primitive finite affine-secant
  container bound, while keeping the scalar full-support list container as a
  parallel wall.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 58 5.5 Pro upper-wall audit

- **Agent/model:** Codex auditing nine external 5.5 Pro lanes.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle58_5p5_upper_audit.md`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/cycle58_5p5_raw/`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / EXPERIMENTAL, with COUNTEREXAMPLE subresults to
  overbroad upper targets.
- **What is being added:** A conservative synthesis of the nine Cycle 58
  theorem-worker responses, plus raw response preservation and checksums.
- **How it is useful:** Cuts the pure `n^{1+o(1)}` upper target, identifies the
  necessary occupancy/main term, confirms that literal quotient pullback is too
  narrow, and re-centers the MCA upper wall on a calibrated syndrome
  transverse-secant inverse theorem.
- **What to do next:** Attack
  `W-MCA-CALIBRATED-SYNDROME-TRANSVERSE-SECANT-INVERSE`, beginning with the
  quotient-free, envelope-free same-field bound with the Bessel occupancy term
  included.

### 2026-06-19 - Experimental folder streamlining

- **Agent/model:** Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/README.md`,
  `experimental/notes/README.md`, `experimental/scripts/README.md`,
  `experimental/data/README.md`, plus repository moves under
  `experimental/notes/`, `experimental/scripts/`, `experimental/data/`, and
  `experimental/lean/`.
- **Status:** AUDIT.
- **What is being added:** Reorganized the experimental workspace into four
  durable buckets: notes, scripts, compact data, and Lean. Removed generated
  Python caches and raw/prompt transcript dumps from dated AI-loop artifacts.
- **How it is useful:** Future agents now have a small root surface and a clear
  placement policy. Audited summaries and reproducible scripts remain, while
  bulky model-run provenance that was not needed for review is gone.
- **What to do next:** Keep new work inside the existing buckets, update
  `README.md` if a genuinely new bucket is needed, and avoid adding raw
  transcript archives unless they are the only reproducibility artifact.

### 2026-06-19 - PR #82/#84-#95 experimental integration

- **Agent/model:** AllenGrahamHart, scottdhughes, latifkasuli,
  DannyExperiments PRs, integrated by Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/triage/pr-triage-2026-06-19.md`,
  `experimental/SUMMARY.md`, `experimental/agents-log.md`,
  `experimental/notes/l1/l1_prefix_divisor_count.md`,
  `experimental/notes/l1/l1_quotient_defect_closure.md`,
  `experimental/notes/l1/l1_repaired_locator_theorem_package.md`,
  `experimental/notes/l2/l2_interleaved_dilation_constants.md`,
  `experimental/data/certificates/nfb-frontier-20260619/README.md`,
  `experimental/data/certificates/nfb-frontier-20260619/nfb_deployed_certificate.json`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_residue_line_roadmap.md`, M1 depth-two Kummer notes and
  verifiers, L1/L2 verifier scripts, and the selected
  `experimental/notes/f1/fable-loop/PRZ_REVIEW_INDEX.md` Cycle 49--57 audit
  layer.
- **Status:** PROVED / CONDITIONAL / CONJECTURAL / EXPERIMENTAL / AUDIT, as
  marked per file.
- **What is being added:** Manual integration of the useful recent PRs:
  PR #93 supersedes #85--#91 as the Scott L1 consolidation; PR #84 adds the
  L1 prefix/divisor/Fourier split; PR #92 adds L2 interleaved dilation and
  quotient-core constants; PR #94 adds a compact `F\B` deep-hole certificate
  packet; PR #82 adds the M1 low-slack Kummer/depth-two packet; PR #95 is
  integrated only as review index plus cycle audits, not as a raw 225k-line
  archive.
- **How it is useful:** Gives future work clear entry points: L1 quotient
  floors versus aperiodic Fourier cancellation, M1 two-coordinate/conductor
  targets, L2 aligned interleaved constants, an F1/Paper D explicit-line
  certificate target, and a compact Fable-loop upper-side route map.
- **What to do next:** Run and review the integrated verifiers, add a
  standalone verifier for the NFB JSON certificate, audit the M1 Kummer imports
  before consuming constants, and continue the Fable-loop program from the
  high-`j` constant-rate prompt rather than the cut `t=2,j=2` toy regime.

### 2026-06-18 - PR #79-#81 experimental integration

- **Agent/model:** AllenGrahamHart and scottdhughes PRs, integrated by Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/m1_depth_two_lift_window_theorem.md`,
  `experimental/m1_kummer_weil_import_contract.md`,
  `experimental/m1_support_coefficient_test.md`,
  `experimental/m1_support_occupancy_scan.py`,
  `experimental/m1_support_occupancy_scan.md`,
  `experimental/verify_m1_kummer_divisor_geometry.py`,
  `experimental/verify_m1_slack_two_depth_two_kummer_saturation.py`,
  `experimental/l1_arbitrary_fiber_repair.md`,
  `experimental/verify_l1_arbitrary_fiber_repair.py`,
  `experimental/a0_external_import_source_check_20260618.md`,
  `experimental/a0_import_source_probe.py`,
  `experimental/pr-triage-2026-06-18-round3.md`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** CONDITIONAL / AUDIT / EXPERIMENTAL / COUNTEREXAMPLE.
- **What is being added:** Manual integration of PR #79's M1 depth-two
  Kummer-window material, PR #80's L1 arbitrary-fiber repair note, and PR
  #81's A0 external-import source check.  The M1 material is explicitly
  conditional on the isolated Kummer-Weil import; the L1 material repairs a
  false raw-support arbitrary-fiber route; the A0 material records source
  reachability without closing the Paper D import audit.
- **How it is useful:** Narrows three active ledgers without editing Papers
  A--D: M1 gains a sharper lift-window/saturation audit, L1 gets a corrected
  list-object target, and A0 has a reproducible source-access record for the
  universal-cap import chain.
- **What to do next:** Prove or cite the M1 `16p` Kummer estimate, decide
  whether Paper B should promote `ImgFib_U(s)` or another repaired L1 object,
  and obtain the CS25/ABF PDFs needed to close the remaining A0 checks.

### 2026-06-18 - Four-item packet label clarification

- **Agent/model:** Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/experiments.tex`,
  `experimental/experiments.pdf`, `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / CLARIFICATION.
- **What is being added:** Adds a self-contained explanation of what the
  AI-packet labels (a)--(d) mean: weak-slack positive regime, finite
  Fermat-prime packet, exponential-field construction, and imported BCHKS
  quotient-locator packet.
- **How it is useful:** Makes the experimental PDF readable without knowing
  the earlier discussion, and separates imported locator material from the
  independent local Paper B divisibility-gate theorem.
- **What to do next:** If the original four-item packet is archived in the
  repo, cross-link this clarification to the exact source file or PR.

### 2026-06-18 - Streamlined imported-locator ledger

- **Agent/model:** Human-provided streamlined note, logged by Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/experiments.tex`,
  `experimental/experiments.pdf`, `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / IMPORTED / WRAPPER / TARGET / NEW-LOCAL.
- **What is being added:** Replaces the narrower attribution note with a
  unified experimental ledger titled *Experimental Theorems and
  Imported-Locator Ledger for RS-MCA*.  The note explicitly imports the
  Ben-Sasson--Carmon--Habock--Kopparty--Saraf quotient-locator construction,
  gives the smooth-quotient notation dictionary, records the shared locator
  identity as imported rather than new, adds a list-fiber pigeonhole wrapper,
  states a slack-two/subfield target for the Paper D route, and preserves the
  Cycle 14--18 Paper B divisibility-gate theorem.
- **How it is useful:** Streamlines promotion decisions for Papers A--D:
  locator proofs from BCHKS must be cited at theorem and proof entry points;
  repository-side contributions are limited to dictionary/wrapper/ledger
  packaging unless separately proved; Paper D gets a precise augmented-code
  and subfield-pigeonhole target; Paper B keeps the independent restricted
  resonance gate as local experimental mathematics.
- **What to do next:** When editing the main papers, add the `BCHKS25`
  bibliography entry and cite Theorems 7.1 and 1.13 exactly where the locator
  construction is used.  Audit the augmented-code rung, slope field
  (`B` versus `F`), locator-codeword distinctness, and slack normalization
  before promoting any wrapper to a theorem.  Continue scanner work on the
  `G==0` divisibility-gate branch for the Paper B resonance window.

### 2026-06-18 - Proximity-gap attribution audit

- **Agent/model:** Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/experiments.tex`,
  `experimental/experiments.pdf`, `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / ATTRIBUTION.
- **What is being added:** Records that the AI-generated result (d) should be
  treated as an imported adaptation of Theorem 1.13 of
  Ben-Sasson--Carmon--Habock--Kopparty--Saraf, *On proximity gaps for
  Reed--Solomon codes*, rather than as a new repository contribution.  Also
  records the limitations of items (a)--(c): `1/sqrt(n)` slack, only three
  Fermat primes, and exponential field size.
- **How it is useful:** Gives Papers B/D/C a conservative integration plan:
  cite the external theorem, separate it from the Crites--Stewart import, and
  audit the consumed object before any MCA, line-decoding, or protocol ledger
  claim.
- **What to do next:** Add the bibliographic entry and exact theorem
  cross-reference when the main papers are edited, then verify whether item
  (d) converts to the RS-MCA object actually needed by Paper B.

### 2026-06-18 - PR #78 M1 residual-depth hierarchy

- **Agent/model:** AllenGrahamHart / Codex, integrated by Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/m1_support_coefficient_test.md`,
  `experimental/m1_support_occupancy_scan.py`,
  `experimental/m1_support_occupancy_scan.md`,
  `experimental/verify_m1_slack_two_depth_two_full_domain.py`,
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROVED / AUDIT / EXPERIMENTAL.
- **What is being added:** Integrated Allen's PR #78 M1 residual-depth
  hierarchy: the depth-two/next-slack transition theorem, terminal pure-zero
  residual-depth ledger, first-nonzero frontier partition, full-domain
  slack-two depth-two saturation verifier, and a high-index ceiling for the
  slack-two depth-two frontier.
- **How it is useful:** Separates inherited zero strata from genuinely new
  first-nonzero coefficient images in the M1 canonical-support scanner, giving
  sharper targets for Paper B's corrected MCA residue-line program.
- **What to do next:** Use the new verifier and scanner fields to attack
  proper-subgroup coset-image bounds, especially intermediate-index cases not
  decided by full-domain saturation or the coarse high-index ceiling.

### 2026-06-18 - Experimental theorem note

- **Agent/model:** Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/experiments.tex`,
  `experimental/experiments.pdf`, `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROVED / HEURISTIC / AUDIT.
- **What is being added:** A standalone LaTeX note collecting restricted
  Cycle 14--18 theorems and heuristics, including the Cycle 18
  divisibility-gate theorem with proof.
- **How it is useful:** Gives the experimental proof material a citable,
  compiled form without editing Papers A--D.
- **What to do next:** Extend the scanner to test the `G==0` gate and decide
  whether any source-valid growing-prime family has two-dimensional slope-map
  image.

### 2026-06-18 - Cycle 18 resonance slope-map reconstruction

- **Agent/model:** Codex.
- **Files added or changed:**
  `experimental/notes/f1/fable-loop/audits/20260618_CYCLE18_RESONANCE_SLOPE_MAP_COLLAPSE_AUDIT.md`,
  `experimental/scripts/fable_loop/local_checks/20260618_cycle18_resonance_slope_symbolic.py`,
  `experimental/notes/f1/fable-loop/README.md`,
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** BANKABLE_LEMMA / EXACT_NEW_WALL / AUDIT.
- **What is being added:** A local reconstruction of Danny's Cycle 18
  `t=2,j=3` resonance reduction: `Delta` becomes a monic quadratic in
  `tau3`, the alpha component is at most linear, and the non-coprime branch
  reduces to either `Delta1==0` or the graph `tau3=-h/s`. The audit also
  records the divisibility-gate theorem: if the cleared graph polynomial
  `G=s^2 Delta0(tau1,tau2,-h/s)` is nonzero, the branch is already
  curve-sized and contributes only `O(p)` slopes.
- **How it is useful:** Sharpens the Paper B/F1 restricted toy-window wall
  from the Cycle 16 `Q==0` split to a concrete rational slope-map collapse
  question.
- **What to do next:** Extend the Cycle 17 scanner to compute the graph branch
  and projective map image on source-valid split cubics across growing primes,
  with `G==0` as the first exact gate for possible `Theta(p^2)` behavior.

### 2026-06-18 - Paper B counterexample comparison

- **Agent/model:** Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/paper_b_counterexample_comparison.md`,
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / EXPERIMENTAL.
- **What is being added:** A theory-side comparison between recent
  experimental counterexamples and Paper B's locator-fiber, residue-line,
  extension-field, tangent-floor, and line-decoding statements.
- **How it is useful:** Identifies the raw arbitrary locator-fiber conjecture
  as needing repair, while separating route-cut counterexamples from genuine
  threats to the corrected MCA conjecture.
- **What to do next:** Review the proposed Paper B repairs, especially the
  replacement of raw `Fib_U` by a pruned/full-support arbitrary-word object.

### 2026-06-18 - Experimental summary

- **Agent/model:** Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/SUMMARY.md`,
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / EXPERIMENTAL.
- **What is being added:** A high-level summary of the recent PR wave and the
  current contents of `experimental/`, organized by how the material advances
  the corrected MCA program.
- **How it is useful:** Gives new agents and human reviewers a map of which
  experimental notes support L1, M1, M2, F1, L2, A0/A1, protocol ledgers, and
  formalization, while keeping proof status conservative.
- **What to do next:** Use the summary as an orientation map, then verify
  individual claims from their source notes and scripts before promotion.

### 2026-06-18 - New PR triage integration

- **Agent/model:** Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** Integrated experimental material from PRs #67,
  #69, #70, #71, #72, #73, #74, #75, and #77; recorded #68 and #76 as
  superseded by #77; added `experimental/pr-triage-2026-06-18.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / EXPERIMENTAL.
- **What is being added:** Second open-PR triage pass covering M1, F1, L2,
  M2, L1, A1, Fable-loop, and locator-fiber cross-check contributions.
- **How it is useful:** Banks useful experimental notes, verifiers, scanners,
  and audit provenance while preserving the rule that main papers remain
  unchanged and new material stays in `experimental/`.
- **What to do next:** Run full verifier coverage, review mathematical claims
  before promotion, and close the source PRs as manually integrated or
  superseded once this commit is pushed.

### 2026-06-17 - Open PR triage integration

- **Agent/model:** Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** Integrated experimental material from PRs #1,
  #2, #3, and #46 through #66; added
  `experimental/pr-triage-2026-06-17.md`; renamed PR #55's dither scanner to
  `experimental/quotient_profile_dither.py` with matching `.md` note.
- **Status:** AUDIT / EXPERIMENTAL.
- **What is being added:** One-by-one triage of the open PR queue and local
  integration of accepted experimental notes, scanners, certificates, and
  audit bundles.
- **How it is useful:** Preserves useful agent contributions while enforcing
  the repository rule that new material starts in `experimental/` and Papers
  A-D remain unchanged.
- **What to do next:** Run verifiers and audits on the integrated material,
  review mathematical notes before promotion, and close the original PRs as
  manually integrated once the integration commit is pushed.
