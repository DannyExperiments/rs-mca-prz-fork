# Agents Log

This file is the working ledger for agent-created material in `experimental/`.
Use it to record every new note, script, scan, formalization stub, or audit before
the material is promoted into `tex/` or `scripts/`.

The log is not a proof-status authority. It is a coordination record: what was
added, why it might matter, and what a human or later agent should check next.
Keep entries concise and link to the relevant files.

## Entry Format

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD - Short title

- **Agent/model:** Name the agent or model, for example `GPT-5.5 Pro`,
  `Claude Fable 5`, or `Codex`.
- **Files added or changed:** List paths under `experimental/`, `tex/`,
  or `scripts/`.
- **Status:** PROVED / CONDITIONAL / CONJECTURAL / EXPERIMENTAL / AUDIT /
  COUNTEREXAMPLE.
- **What is being added:** State the claim, note, scan, script, or certificate
  in one or two sentences.
- **How it is useful:** Say which paper, theorem, problem, ledger, or toy case
  the material supports.
- **What to do next:** Give the next verification, cleanup, proof step,
  experiment, or promotion decision.
```

## Entries

### 2026-06-21 - Cycle 84 GitHub replay passed

- **Agent/model:** Codex plus GitHub Actions public replay.
- **Files added or changed:**
  `.github/workflows/cycle84-certificate-replay.yml`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/cycle84_github_replay_receipt.md`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle84_wallbreaker_returns_audit.md`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROOF / BANKABLE_LEMMA / AUDIT.
- **What is being added:** GitHub Actions run `27889140962` passed both jobs:
  `Light certificate chain` and `Full projected census and kernel lift`. The
  public replay returned `CYCLE84_EXACT_MMAX2_CERTIFICATE_VERIFIED`,
  `TAU_FOLDED_PROJECTED_MMAX_LE_12`, and `KERNEL_3_DUPLICATE_LIFT_COMPLETE`,
  with `m_max(beta)=2`, `Occ(beta)=52,747,567,092`, and ordered off-diagonal
  energy `D=24`.
- **How it is useful:** Upgrades Cycle84 from a worker-provided full census plus
  local lightweight verifier to a public GitHub full replay receipt. This
  closes the finite model wall `W-CYCLE84-MITM-DUPLICATE-DETECTOR-EXECUTION`;
  it still does not prove the full RS-MCA/prize theorem.
- **What to do next:** Execute
  `L-CYCLE85-EXACT-ROLE05-OCCUPANCY-TRANSFER`: splice the exact finite
  occupancy `52,747,567,092 > 2^32` through the banked Cycle65-68
  locator-evaluation reduction and record the finite frontier-ledger entry.

### 2026-06-21 - Cycle 84 GitHub replay workflow template staged

- **Agent/model:** Codex.
- **Files added or changed:**
  `experimental/notes/m1/cycle84_github_replay_workflow/` and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / VERIFICATION.
- **What is being added:** A manual-dispatch GitHub Actions workflow template
  for the Cycle84 certificate. The live `.github/workflows/` push was blocked
  because the available OAuth token lacks GitHub's `workflow` scope, so the
  workflow is preserved under `experimental/` for a maintainer or authorized
  token to install.
- **How it is useful:** Provides a public, timestamped replay path for the
  `m_max(beta)=2` finite-wall certificate, so reviewers can inspect a GitHub
  runner receipt rather than relying only on local machine output.
- **What to do next:** Copy
  `experimental/notes/m1/cycle84_github_replay_workflow/cycle84-certificate-replay.yml`
  into `.github/workflows/` using a credential with `workflow` scope, then
  dispatch it on `cycle58-5p5-audit` with `run_full_replay=true`; if GitHub
  runner limits block the full replay, keep the light receipt and move the
  heavy replay to a larger VM.

### 2026-06-21 - Cycle 84 wallbreaker returns banked

- **Agent/model:** External Pro theorem-worker returns, audited by Codex with a
  local lightweight certificate verifier.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle84_wallbreaker_returns_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle84_wallbreaker_returns_audit.md`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROOF / BANKABLE_LEMMA.
- **What is being added:** Multiple Cycle84 returns independently converge on
  `m_max(beta)=2` for the explicit seven-slot color-filtered finite model.
  Codex locally ran the strongest bundle's lightweight verifier and obtained
  `CYCLE84_EXACT_MMAX2_CERTIFICATE_VERIFIED`, with occupancy
  `52,747,567,092` and ordered off-diagonal energy `24`.
- **How it is useful:** Closes the finite wall
  `W-CYCLE84-MITM-DUPLICATE-DETECTOR-EXECUTION` far past the needed
  `m_max(beta)<=12` threshold. There is no 13-fold colored packet in this
  explicit model; indeed there is no 3-fold packet.
- **What to do next:** Bank/promote
  `L-CYCLE84-EXACT-COLOR-FILTERED-MMAX`, then execute
  `L-CYCLE85-EXACT-ROLE05-OCCUPANCY-TRANSFER`: splice the exact spectrum and
  `Occ(beta)>2^32` into the finite frontier ledger without claiming the full
  prize theorem.

### 2026-06-21 - Cycle 84 MITM wallbreaker packet staged

- **Agent/model:** Codex staging a nine-instance Pro wallbreaker round.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle84_mitm_wallbreaker_packet/`
  and `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROMPT PACKET / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** A targeted nine-role prompt packet for the exact
  finite wall left by Cycle 83: prove `m_max(beta)<=12`, find an explicit
  13-fold colored packet, or specify a reproducible MITM duplicate-detector
  certificate. The shared context zip is
  `/Users/danielcabezas/20260621_cycle84_mitm_wallbreaker_context.zip`.
- **How it is useful:** Keeps the next Pro round on the sharpened finite
  threshold problem rather than broad prize-level brainstorming. Roles split
  across direct proof, counterpacket hunting, duplicate-detector design,
  min-distance-5 strengthening, tau-symmetric energy, ratio cliques, external
  census certificates, small-model testing, and referee route selection.
- **What to do next:** Upload the context zip to each Pro instance, paste
  `COMMON_PROMPT.md`, then append exactly one role prompt.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 83 MITM threshold plan banked

- **Agent/model:** `claude-opus-4-8` via Packy/Fable `artifact_stream`,
  audited by Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle83_mitm_mmax_threshold_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle83_mitm_mmax_threshold_audit.md`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** EXACT_NEW_WALL / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** Cycle 83 does not prove `m_max(beta)<=12` and does
  not find a 13-fold packet. It sharpens the remaining wall to a color-filtered
  MITM threshold census capped at `13`, with resource tiers for Bloom duplicate
  detection, deterministic shard/reduce, or recompute sharding.
- **How it is useful:** Confirms the injectivity ladder cannot by itself reach
  the constant `12`; the remaining target is an actual no-13 threshold
  certificate or explicit 13-fold packet.
- **What to do next:** Resolve execution resources. The local Mac had only
  about 118MiB free before preview-cache cleanup and remains far below the
  `66GB` RAM / `0.5-0.85TB` scratch tiers proposed for the census.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 82 four-slot product certificate banked

- **Agent/model:** `claude-opus-4-8` via Packy/Fable `artifact_stream`,
  audited by Codex with a local NumPy verifier.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle82_four_slot_or_mitm_mmax_raw/`,
  `experimental/scripts/cycle82_four_slot_product_checker.py`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/cycle82_four_slot_product_smoke_certificate.json`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/cycle82_four_slot_product_certificate.json`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle82_four_slot_or_mitm_mmax_audit.md`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/cycle83_mitm_mmax_threshold_packet/`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROOF / BANKABLE_LEMMA / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** Codex locally executed the exact four-slot checker
  and certified all 35 four-slot product maps are injective. The certificate
  decision is `ALL_4_SUBSETS_PRODUCT_INJECTIVE`, giving product-fiber minimum
  distance at least `5`.
- **How it is useful:** Removes the four-slot injectivity guardrail from the
  live finite wall and narrows the M1 target to the exact color-filtered MITM
  threshold census for `m_max(beta)<=12`.
- **What to do next:** Launch Cycle 83 against
  `V-CYCLE83-MITM-MMAX-THRESHOLD-CERTIFICATE`, seeking either a reproducible
  no-13 threshold certificate or an explicit 13-fold colored packet.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 82 four-slot/MITM prompt staged

- **Agent/model:** Codex staging next Packy/Fable prompt after Cycle 81.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle82_four_slot_or_mitm_mmax_packet/`
  and `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROMPT PACKET / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** A targeted prompt for
  `V-CYCLE82-FOUR-SLOT-OR-MITM-MMAX-CERTIFICATE`, asking for a compiled
  four-slot product-injectivity certificate, explicit four-slot collision, or
  direct color-filtered MITM `m_max` census.
- **How it is useful:** Moves past the now-certified three-slot rung toward
  the next finite certificate needed for the `m_max(beta)<=12` wall.
- **What to do next:** Refresh the Packy/Fable source snapshot, preview,
  launch Cycle 82, and heartbeat the run.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 81 compiled three-slot certificate return banked

- **Agent/model:** `claude-opus-4-8` via Packy/Fable `artifact_stream`,
  audited by Codex with a local vectorized NumPy verifier.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle81_compiled_three_slot_certificate_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle81_compiled_three_slot_certificate_audit.md`,
  `experimental/scripts/cycle81_vectorized_three_slot_checker.py`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/cycle81_three_slot_injectivity_certificate.json`,
  and `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROOF / BANKABLE_LEMMA / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** Codex locally executed the vectorized exact checker
  and certified all 35 three-slot product maps are injective. The certificate
  decision is `ALL_3_SUBSETS_PRODUCT_INJECTIVE`, giving product-fiber minimum
  distance at least `4`.
- **How it is useful:** Closes the finite three-slot rung below the
  coherent-ratio route and removes all product collisions through weight `3`.
- **What to do next:** Attack all four-slot product maps or move directly to
  the color-filtered L/R MITM `m_max` census.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 81 compiled three-slot certificate prompt staged

- **Agent/model:** Codex staging next Packy/Fable prompt after Cycle 80.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle81_compiled_three_slot_certificate_packet/`
  and `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROMPT PACKET / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** A targeted prompt for
  `V-CYCLE81-COMPILED-THREE-SLOT-CERTIFICATE`, demanding an executable
  all-triples product-injectivity certificate or an explicit three-slot
  collision packet.
- **How it is useful:** Moves the route from unrun checker sketches to the
  exact finite certificate needed to bank the minimum-distance rung.
- **What to do next:** Refresh the Packy/Fable source snapshot, preview,
  launch Cycle 81, and heartbeat the run.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 80 mindistance/symmetric-energy return banked

- **Agent/model:** `claude-opus-4-8` via Packy/Fable `artifact_stream`,
  audited by Codex with a preserved checker and interrupted local run.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle80_mindist_symmetric_energy_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle80_mindist_symmetric_energy_audit.md`,
  `experimental/scripts/cycle80_three_slot_injectivity_checker.py`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** BANKABLE_LEMMA / ROUTE_CUT / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** Cycle 80 banks the weight-3 structure lemma and
  ratio-triple reformulation: all three-slot collisions must differ in all
  three slots, and a triple is injective iff `(R_t1 R_t2) cap R_t3` is empty.
- **How it is useful:** Identifies the exact finite minimum-distance rung below
  the coherent-ratio route and gives a certificate schema.
- **What to do next:** Produce an actual compiled/vectorized all-triples
  certificate or explicit collision packet; the preserved pure-Python checker
  was too slow for a heartbeat-local run.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 80 mindistance/symmetric-energy prompt staged

- **Agent/model:** Codex staging next Packy/Fable prompt after Cycle 79.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle80_mindist_symmetric_energy_packet/`
  and `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROMPT PACKET / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** A targeted prompt for
  `V-CYCLE80-MINDIST-OR-SYMMETRIC-ENERGY`, asking for an exact all-triples
  product-injectivity proof, an explicit three-slot collision packet, or a
  theorem-grade optimized certificate design.
- **How it is useful:** Uses the only new Cycle 79 structure, tau symmetry,
  while first closing the finite product-fiber minimum-distance rung.
- **What to do next:** Refresh the Packy/Fable source snapshot, preview,
  launch Cycle 80, and heartbeat the run.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 79 common-ratio return banked

- **Agent/model:** `claude-opus-4-8` via Packy/Fable `artifact_stream`,
  audited by Codex with a local involution verifier.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle79_common_ratio_bound_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle79_common_ratio_bound_audit.md`,
  `experimental/scripts/cycle79_involution_verifier.py`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/cycle79_involution_certificate.json`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** BANKABLE_LEMMA / ROUTE_CUT / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** Cycle 79 banks the complement involution
  `tau(1,a)=(2,a+6)`, `tau(2,a)=(1,a+10)`, `tau(3,a)=(3,a+8)`, with
  `Phi(tau(T))=K/Phi(T)` and `tau(P_0)=P_0`. It also cuts the coherent-ratio
  formulation alone as equivalent to the original fiber count.
- **How it is useful:** Adds a real symmetry constraint `m(v)=m(K/v)` for the
  finite model and narrows the next wall to exact minimum distance or a
  tau-symmetric energy bound.
- **What to do next:** Decide all three-slot product collisions or prove a
  tau-symmetric energy bound strong enough to approach `m_max(beta)<=12`.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 79 common-ratio prompt staged

- **Agent/model:** Codex staging next Packy/Fable prompt after Cycle 78.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle79_common_ratio_bound_packet/`
  and `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROMPT PACKET / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** A targeted prompt for
  `V-CYCLE79-COMMON-RATIO-BOUND-OR-CENSUS`, asking for a coherent
  common-ratio set bound, an explicit coherent size-13 witness, or a smaller
  exact wall.
- **How it is useful:** Moves beyond repeated census planning toward the
  sharpest non-computational finite object extracted by Cycle 78.
- **What to do next:** Refresh the Packy/Fable source snapshot, preview, launch
  Cycle 79, and heartbeat the run.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 78 exact mmax census return banked

- **Agent/model:** `claude-opus-4-8` via Packy/Fable `artifact_stream`,
  audited by Codex with a bounded LR-incidence sanity check.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle78_exact_mmax_census_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle78_exact_mmax_census_audit.md`,
  `experimental/scripts/cycle78_lr_incidence_sanity.py`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/cycle78_lr_incidence_sanity_certificate.json`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** BANKABLE_LEMMA / ROUTE_CUT / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** Cycle 78 banks the exact left-right incidence
  reduction for product fibers and cuts another broad hand/census-planning
  attempt. Codex locally sanity-checked the product/color decomposition on 25
  deterministic sample pairs.
- **How it is useful:** Defines the precise finite object:
  `m(v)=#{l in L_img : v l^{-1} in R_img and color-compatible}` and isolates
  the coherent common-ratio set as the next proof target.
- **What to do next:** Stage Cycle 79 against coherent ratio-set size bounds or
  explicit size-13 witness construction.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 78 exact mmax census prompt staged

- **Agent/model:** Codex staging next Packy/Fable prompt after Cycle 77.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle78_exact_mmax_census_packet/`
  and `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROMPT PACKET / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** A targeted execution-focused prompt for
  `V-CYCLE78-EXACT-MMAX-CENSUS`, asking for exact `m_max<=12`,
  an explicit `13`-fold packet, or a compiled/executable all-subset product
  collision certificate.
- **How it is useful:** Moves the finite model route away from abstract
  hand-proof attempts and toward theorem-grade computation or explicit
  falsification.
- **What to do next:** Refresh the Packy/Fable source snapshot, preview, launch
  Cycle 78, and heartbeat the run.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 77 AB product maxfiber return banked

- **Agent/model:** `claude-opus-4-8` via Packy/Fable `artifact_stream`,
  audited by Codex with a local pair-subset injectivity checker.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle77_ab_product_maxfiber_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle77_ab_product_maxfiber_audit.md`,
  `experimental/scripts/cycle77_subset_injectivity_check.py`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/cycle77_subset_injectivity_pairs_certificate.json`,
  and `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** BANKABLE_LEMMA / ROUTE_CUT / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** Cycle 77 banks the configuration-evaluation
  reduction and fiber-as-code lemma, but cuts the idea that the constant `12`
  is likely to fall from a short hand proof. Codex locally certified all
  singleton and pair slot-product maps: 28 subsets, all product-injective.
- **How it is useful:** Establishes product-fiber minimum distance at least `3`
  and narrows the live target to exact census, explicit `13`-fold packet, or
  stronger all-subset injectivity certificates.
- **What to do next:** Stage Cycle 78 against exact `m_max` census or compiled
  product-collision certification.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 77 AB product maxfiber prompt staged

- **Agent/model:** Codex staging next Packy/Fable prompt after Cycle 76.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle77_ab_product_maxfiber_packet/`
  and `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROMPT PACKET / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** A targeted prompt for
  `V-CYCLE77-AB-PRODUCT-MAXFIBER`, starting from the now-certified
  product-injective MITM split `A={slots 1,2,3}` and `B={slots 4,5,6,7}`.
- **How it is useful:** Moves the route past injectivity ladders to the exact
  remaining max-intersection wall `max_v |A cap v B^{-1}| <= 12`, or an
  explicit `13`-fold fiber in `P_0`.
- **What to do next:** Refresh the Packy/Fable source snapshot, preview, launch
  Cycle 77, and heartbeat the run.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 76 right-half/mmax return banked

- **Agent/model:** `claude-opus-4-8` via Packy/Fable `artifact_stream`,
  audited by Codex with a local optimized right-half checker.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle76_right_half_mmax_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle76_right_half_mmax_audit.md`,
  `experimental/scripts/cycle76_fast_right_half_check.py`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** BANKABLE_LEMMA / PROOF / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** Cycle 76 banks the one-sided injective-fiber
  reduction. Codex locally certified product-only injectivity for right slots
  `{4,5,6,7}` with `5308416` distinct products on `5308416` tuples.
- **How it is useful:** Completes the MITM product-injective split. The
  remaining model wall is no longer another ladder rung; it is the exact
  product-set intersection bound `max_v |A cap v B^{-1}| <= 12`.
- **What to do next:** Stage Cycle 77 against the `A*B` max-fiber problem, or
  produce an explicit `13`-fold packet in `P_0`.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 76 right-half/mmax prompt staged

- **Agent/model:** Codex staging next Packy/Fable prompt after Cycle 75.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle76_right_half_mmax_packet/`
  and `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROMPT PACKET / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** A targeted prompt for
  `V-CYCLE76-RIGHT-HALF-AND-MMAX-CENSUS`, asking for right-half
  product-injectivity, a compiled/sharded direct max-fiber census, or an
  explicit 13-fold collision packet.
- **How it is useful:** Continues the direct `m_max(beta)<=12` route after
  Codex locally certified the MITM left half `{1,2,3}`.
- **What to do next:** Refresh the Packy/Fable source snapshot, preview, launch
  Cycle 76, and heartbeat the run.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 75 direct mmax fiber return banked

- **Agent/model:** `claude-opus-4-8` via Packy/Fable `artifact_stream`,
  audited by Codex with a bounded local MITM half-rung checker.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle75_direct_mmax_fiber_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle75_direct_mmax_fiber_audit.md`,
  `experimental/scripts/cycle75_mitm_half_rung_check.py`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/cycle75_mitm_half_rung_certificate.json`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** BANKABLE_LEMMA / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** Cycle 75 banks a meet-in-the-middle
  subfield-norm-sharded direct max-fiber census design, corrects the collision
  heuristic to the constrained-domain scale, and cuts ladder-only closure.
  Codex locally certified product-only injectivity for left slots `{1,2,3}`.
- **How it is useful:** Moves the finite model route toward direct
  `m_max(beta)<=12` certification and gives one executed supporting rung.
- **What to do next:** Stage Cycle 76 for right-half `{4,5,6,7}` certification
  or a compiled/sharded direct max-fiber census.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 75 direct mmax fiber prompt staged

- **Agent/model:** Codex staging next Packy/Fable prompt after Cycle 74.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle75_direct_mmax_fiber_packet/`
  and `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROMPT PACKET / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** A targeted prompt for
  `V-CYCLE75-DIRECT-MMAX-FIBER-CENSUS`, shifting from the likely-too-strong
  total-energy gate `D<=155` to direct certification of `m_max(beta)<=12`.
- **How it is useful:** Targets the actual obstruction threshold, a 13-fold
  fiber, rather than trying to prove an apparently false total collision-energy
  smallness bound.
- **What to do next:** Refresh the Packy/Fable source snapshot, preview, launch
  Cycle 75, and heartbeat the run.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 74 norm-bucket ladder return banked

- **Agent/model:** `claude-opus-4-8` via Packy/Fable `artifact_stream`,
  audited by Codex with a heuristic arithmetic check.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle74_norm_bucket_ladder_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle74_norm_bucket_ladder_audit.md`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** ROUTE_CUT / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** Cycle 74 again does not execute the ladder, but cuts
  the `D<=155` route as likely too strong: `(48^7)^2/(17^16-1) ~= 7082.63`,
  so total off-diagonal energy may exceed 155 even when max fiber remains
  below 13.
- **How it is useful:** Refocuses the finite model route on direct
  `m_max(beta)<=12` certification or explicit 13-fold collision.
- **What to do next:** Stage Cycle 75 against direct max-fiber census, using
  norm buckets and the color constraint as sharding/filtering tools.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 74 norm-bucket ladder prompt staged

- **Agent/model:** Codex staging next Packy/Fable prompt after Cycle 73.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle74_norm_bucket_ladder_packet/`
  and `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROMPT PACKET / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** A targeted execution/certificate prompt for
  `V-CYCLE74-NORM-BUCKET-COMPILED-LADDER-RUN`, using the Cycle 73 prime-field
  slot polynomial identity and sound norm buckets.
- **How it is useful:** Pushes the route away from repeated unrun verifier
  sketches and toward an actual product-only ladder certificate or explicit
  collision.
- **What to do next:** Refresh the Packy/Fable source snapshot, preview, launch
  Cycle 74, and heartbeat the run.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 73 compiled product ladder return banked

- **Agent/model:** `claude-opus-4-8` via Packy/Fable `artifact_stream`,
  audited by Codex with a bounded local self-check.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle73_compiled_product_ladder_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle73_compiled_product_ladder_audit.md`,
  `experimental/scripts/cycle73_prime_slot_norm_check.py`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/cycle73_prime_slot_norm_certificate.json`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** BANKABLE_LEMMA / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** Cycle 73 does not execute the expensive ladder, but
  banks the prime-field slot polynomial identity, sound norm bucket strategy,
  and unconstrained-energy dominance. Codex locally checked all 336 slot
  identities, `eta^16=3`, the Cycle 70 false-collapse failure, and bounded
  norm homomorphism samples.
- **How it is useful:** Gives the correct lossless bucketing mechanism for a
  memory-bounded compiled verifier and strengthens independent arithmetic
  self-checks.
- **What to do next:** Stage Cycle 74 as an execution-focused norm-bucket
  compiled run. Do not accept another unrun pass as evidence.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 73 compiled product ladder prompt staged

- **Agent/model:** Codex staging next Packy/Fable prompt after Cycle 72.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle73_compiled_product_ladder_packet/`
  and `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROMPT PACKET / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** A targeted prompt for
  `V-CYCLE72-COMPILED-PRODUCT-ONLY-LADDER-AND-ENERGY`, requiring a real
  product-only verifier/certificate, structural proof, or explicit collision
  for the remaining `k=3/k=4` rungs, with the Cycle 72 displacement-energy
  decomposition queued as the next gate.
- **How it is useful:** Prevents another unrun or color-key pass from being
  mistaken for evidence and ties the next computation directly to the
  `D<=155` multiplicity threshold.
- **What to do next:** Refresh the Packy/Fable source snapshot, preview, launch
  Cycle 73, and heartbeat the run.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 72 product-only ladder return banked

- **Agent/model:** `claude-opus-4-8` via Packy/Fable `artifact_stream`,
  audited by Codex with a bounded local follow-up attempt.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle72_product_only_ladder_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle72_product_only_ladder_audit.md`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / BANKABLE_LEMMA / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** Cycle 72 does not prove or kill `k=3/k=4`, because
  the worker had read-only tools and supplied only unrun verifier code. It
  banks the displacement-energy decomposition
  `D=sum_S 48^(7-|S|) E_S`, which makes `k=5` injectivity mandatory if the
  `D<=155` route is to survive after a `k=4` pass.
- **How it is useful:** Converts the post-ladder target from vague
  collision-energy counting into exact fully displaced support rungs
  `|S|=5,6,7`.
- **What to do next:** Stage Cycle 73 for an actual compiled/product-only
  verifier or explicit collision. Do not accept unrun pass claims.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 72 product-only ladder prompt staged

- **Agent/model:** Codex staging next Packy/Fable prompt after Cycle 71.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle72_product_only_ladder_packet/`
  and `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROMPT PACKET / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** A targeted prompt for
  `V-CYCLE71-PRODUCT-ONLY-K3-K4-LADDER-RUN`, requiring product-only duplicate
  detection, a proof that product equality forces color equality, or a direct
  partial collision.
- **How it is useful:** Forces the next worker to resolve the verifier
  semantics left by Cycle 71 rather than relying on the unsafe color-key
  shortcut.
- **What to do next:** Refresh the Packy/Fable source snapshot, preview, launch
  Cycle 72, and heartbeat the run.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 71 optimized ladder return banked

- **Agent/model:** `claude-opus-4-8` via Packy/Fable `artifact_stream`,
  audited by Codex with a corrected local product-only checker.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle71_optimized_ladder_run_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle71_optimized_ladder_audit.md`,
  `experimental/scripts/cycle71_product_ladder_checker.py`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/cycle71_product_ladder_certificate.json`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** BANKABLE_LEMMA / PLAN / ROUTE_CUT.
- **What is being added:** Cycle 71 banks the full-displacement lemma for
  minimum-support slot collisions, but does not execute or close `k=3/k=4`.
  Codex cuts the returned Python color-key verifier because `(color, product)`
  is not a valid product-injectivity key unless color is already known to be
  forced by product.
- **How it is useful:** Refines the verifier target to product-only duplicate
  detection and prevents a false color-filter pass from being mistaken for a
  ladder proof.
- **What to do next:** Stage Cycle 72 against
  `V-CYCLE71-PRODUCT-ONLY-K3-K4-LADDER-RUN`, requiring either a real
  product-only optimized run, explicit partial collision, or a proof that
  product equality forces color equality.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 71 optimized ladder prompt staged

- **Agent/model:** Codex staging next Packy/Fable prompt after Cycle 70.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle71_optimized_ladder_run_packet/`
  and `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROMPT PACKET / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** A targeted prompt for
  `V-CYCLE70-K3-K4-OPTIMIZED-LADDER-RUN`, explicitly forbidding the false
  Cycle 70 t-independent collapse and requiring executable verifier progress,
  structural proof, or a direct partial collision.
- **How it is useful:** Keeps the finite model route honest after the Cycle 70
  cut and points the next worker at the actual computational bottleneck.
- **What to do next:** Refresh the Packy/Fable source snapshot, preview, launch
  Cycle 71, and heartbeat the run.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 70 K3/K4 ladder return banked

- **Agent/model:** `claude-opus-4-8` via Packy/Fable `artifact_stream`,
  audited by Codex with a local checker.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle70_k3_k4_ladder_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle70_k3_k4_ladder_audit.md`,
  `experimental/scripts/cycle70_slot_normalization_checker.py`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/cycle70_slot_normalization_certificate.json`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** ROUTE_CUT / BANKABLE_LEMMA / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** Cycle 70 does not prove or falsify the `k=3/k=4`
  ladder. Codex locally cuts the worker's strongest t-independent
  normalization claim with an explicit counterexample, while rechecking the
  surviving Cycle 68 t-dependent polynomial-evaluation identity on all 336
  slot values.
- **How it is useful:** Prevents a false simplification from contaminating the
  route and refocuses the wall on an actual optimized/compiled ladder or
  collision-energy run.
- **What to do next:** Stage Cycle 71 against
  `V-CYCLE70-K3-K4-OPTIMIZED-LADDER-RUN`, requiring an executable exact
  verifier or explicit partial collision rather than a new unrun shortcut.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 70 K3/K4 ladder prompt staged

- **Agent/model:** Codex staging next Packy/Fable prompt after Cycle 69.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle70_k3_k4_ladder_packet/`
  and `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROMPT PACKET / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** A targeted prompt for
  `V-CYCLE69-K3-K4-INJECTIVITY-LADDER`, asking the next worker to prove or
  kill product-injectivity for `k=3` and `k=4`, then push to the
  collision-energy gate `D<=155` if the ladder passes.
- **How it is useful:** Attacks the exact finite bottleneck left by Cycle 69
  before attempting the full seven-slot collision-energy count.
- **What to do next:** Refresh the Packy/Fable source snapshot, preview the
  prompt context, launch Cycle 70 if the snapshot includes the Cycle 69 audit,
  raw response, ladder probe, and Cycle 68 checker, then heartbeat the active
  run.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 69 slot-log independence return banked

- **Agent/model:** `claude-opus-4-8` via Packy/Fable `artifact_stream`,
  audited by Codex with a bounded local ladder probe.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle69_slot_log_independence_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle69_slot_log_independence_audit.md`,
  `experimental/scripts/cycle69_ladder_probe.py`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/cycle69_ladder_probe_certificate.json`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** BANKABLE_LEMMA / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** Cycle 69 banks the energy-to-multiplicity gate
  `D<=155 => m_max<=12`, the injectivity-ladder reduction, and the slot
  complement oracle `S_t(B)S_t(B^c)=beta^32-3^(2t)`. Codex locally verified
  the complement oracle and product-injectivity through `k=2`.
- **How it is useful:** Turns the Cycle 68 seven-slot occupancy target into a
  sharper finite decision problem: either prove the `k=3/k=4` ladder and then
  a support-5 energy bound, count ordered collision energy `D`, or find an
  explicit 13-fold collision.
- **What to do next:** Stage Cycle 70 against
  `V-CYCLE69-K3-K4-INJECTIVITY-LADDER`, preferably asking for an optimized
  verifier or structural proof before attempting the full collision-energy
  count.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 68 collision multiplicity return banked

- **Agent/model:** `claude-opus-4-8` via Packy/Fable `artifact_stream`,
  audited by Codex with a local checker run.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle68_collision_multiplicity_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle68_collision_multiplicity_audit.md`,
  `experimental/scripts/cycle68_slot_factorization_checker.py`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/cycle68_slot_factorization_certificate.json`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** BANKABLE_LEMMA / EXACT_NEW_WALL / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** The Cycle 68 worker proves the disjoint-coset
  factorization
  `rho_beta(T)=(beta-1) prod_t prod_{b in B_t}(beta^2-eta^(2t+16b))`,
  reducing the model occupancy wall to a seven-slot sumset multiplicity
  problem over a 336-entry table. Codex locally ran the checker and validated
  the factorization, color/set-sum bookkeeping, full slot-product oracle, and
  single-slot injectivity.
- **How it is useful:** Gives an executable reduction below the Cycle 67
  `m_max(beta)<=12` target and isolates the remaining symbolic wall as
  `L-CYCLE68-SLOT-LOG-INDEPENDENCE`, or alternatively a compiled bounded
  multiplicity verifier.
- **What to do next:** Stage Cycle 69 to prove/kill slot-log independence or
  specify/write the bounded-multiplicity verifier that certifies
  `m_max(beta)<=12`.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 68 collision multiplicity prompt staged

- **Agent/model:** Codex staging next Packy/Fable prompt after Cycle 67.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle68_collision_multiplicity_packet/`
  and `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROMPT PACKET / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** A targeted prompt for
  `W-CYCLE67-COLLISION-MULTIPLICITY`, asking the next worker to prove
  `m_max(beta) <= 12`, find a 13-fold collision, or specify a bounded
  multiplicity verifier for the explicit Cycle 66 model.
- **How it is useful:** Attacks the exact finite wall left by Cycle 67 and
  avoids both the pure color shortcut and the full `>2^32` materialized
  distinct-value count.
- **What to do next:** Refresh the Packy/Fable source snapshot, run a no-token
  preview, launch Cycle 68 if the preview includes the Cycle 67 audit/raw
  answer and Cycle 66 self-check, then heartbeat the active run.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 67 cross-color injectivity return banked

- **Agent/model:** `claude-opus-4-8` via Packy/Fable `artifact_stream`,
  audited by Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle67_cross_color_injectivity_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle67_cross_color_injectivity_audit.md`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** EXACT_NEW_WALL / BANKABLE_LEMMA / ROUTE_CUT / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** The Cycle 67 worker cuts the pure color-class
  shortcut and replaces it with the exact finite multiplicity target
  `m_max(beta) <= 12`, where `Occ(beta) >= |P_0|/m_max(beta)` and
  `|P_0|/12 > 2^32`. It also banks the shared-jet collision reduction
  `deg(P_T-P_T') <= 107` and the energy/multiplicity formulation.
- **How it is useful:** Avoids materializing all `>2^32` distinct values and
  gives a sharper executable wall for the Role 05 model obstruction:
  prove no value has more than 12 preimages, or exhibit a 13-fold collision.
- **What to do next:** Stage Cycle 68 against
  `W-CYCLE67-COLLISION-MULTIPLICITY`, asking for a structural proof, explicit
  collision packet, or bounded-multiplicity verifier architecture.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 67 cross-color injectivity prompt staged

- **Agent/model:** Codex staging next Packy/Fable prompt after Cycle 66.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle67_cross_color_injectivity_packet/`
  and `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROMPT PACKET / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** A targeted prompt for
  `L-CYCLE66-CROSS-COLOR-INJECTIVITY-LOWER-BOUND`, asking the next worker to
  prove or kill the proposed symbolic shortcut
  `Occ(beta) >= 8^7 * (# independent color classes)` for the Role 05
  sevenfold product occupancy model.
- **How it is useful:** Tries the remaining proof-scale shortcut before
  committing to a large compiled/external-sort occupancy count over roughly
  52.7 billion constrained products.
- **What to do next:** Refresh the Packy/Fable source snapshot, run a no-token
  preview, launch Cycle 67 if the preview has the expected Cycle 66 audit and
  self-check script, then let the heartbeat monitor completion.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 66 sevenfold product occupancy return banked

- **Agent/model:** `claude-opus-4-8` via Packy/Fable `artifact_stream`,
  audited by Codex with a bounded local self-check.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle66_sevenfold_product_occupancy_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle66_sevenfold_product_occupancy_audit.md`,
  `experimental/scripts/cycle66_occupancy_selfcheck.py`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / BANKABLE_LEMMA / EXACT_NEW_WALL.
- **What is being added:** The Cycle 66 worker corrects the admissibility
  condition to `beta notin mu_256`, reformulates occupancy as distinct
  locator evaluations `rho_beta(T)`, and specifies an implementation path for
  the explicit sevenfold product count. Codex locally verified the finite-field
  setup, constants, and 32 factorization spot checks.
- **How it is useful:** Makes the Role 05 model obstruction executable and
  sharpens the next live target to either cross-color injectivity or a compiled
  occupancy/lower-bound verifier. It does not prove `Occ >= 2^32`.
- **What to do next:** Attack
  `L-CYCLE66-CROSS-COLOR-INJECTIVITY-LOWER-BOUND`; if that fails, build the
  compiled/external-sort or projected-power lower-bound occupancy verifier,
  while keeping finite frontier placement separate.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 66 sevenfold product occupancy prompt staged

- **Agent/model:** Codex staging next Packy/Fable prompt.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle66_sevenfold_product_occupancy_packet/`
  and `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROMPT PACKET / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** A targeted prompt for
  `V-CYCLE65-SEVENFOLD-PRODUCT-OCCUPANCY-VERIFIER`, asking the next worker to
  prove, kill, or make executable the explicit sevenfold product occupancy
  count exposed by Cycle 65.
- **How it is useful:** Keeps the loop on the finite arithmetic decision that
  now controls whether the Role 05 thickened color model gives a `t=1` MCA
  obstruction above `2^32`.
- **What to do next:** Refresh the Packy/Fable source snapshot, run a no-token
  preview, launch Cycle 66 if the preview has the expected files, then let the
  heartbeat monitor completion.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 65 thickened gadget color return banked

- **Agent/model:** `claude-opus-4-8` via Packy/Fable `artifact_stream`,
  audited by Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle65_thickened_gadget_color_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle65_thickened_gadget_color_audit.md`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** BANKABLE_LEMMA / ROUTE_CUT / EXACT_NEW_WALL.
- **What is being added:** The Cycle 65 worker reduces thickened MCA color
  occupancy to an explicit constrained sevenfold product-set in `F_{17^16}^*`,
  proves the exact local factorization through three degree-8 polynomials, and
  cuts the hoped symbolic collapse to product color or truncated jet.
- **How it is useful:** Replaces a broad structural wall with the finite
  verifier target
  `V-CYCLE65-SEVENFOLD-PRODUCT-OCCUPANCY-VERIFIER`; the live decision is now
  whether occupied thickened colors exceed the `2^32` model line for an
  explicit admissible `(eta,beta)`.
- **What to do next:** Implement or prompt the sevenfold product occupancy
  verifier, then pair any large occupancy result with
  `RS-PRIZE-FRONTIER-V1-REGISTRY-FIRST-RUN` before calling it prize-relevant.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 65 thickened gadget color prompt launched

- **Agent/model:** Codex launching `claude-opus-4-8` via Packy/Fable
  `artifact_stream`.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle65_thickened_gadget_color_packet/`
  and `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROMPT PACKET / ACTIVE RUN.
- **What is being added:** A targeted Cycle 65 worker prompt for
  `W-MODEL-GJ-THICKENED-GADGET-COLOR-OCCUPANCY`, the exact wall exposed by
  Cycle 64 after prefix-gadget charge was shown to equal scalar support mass.
- **How it is useful:** Keeps the loop focused on the live prize-relevant
  object: occupied thickened colors for the Role 05 model packet, rather than
  total scalar support mass.
- **What to do next:** Monitor the active run
  `/Users/danielcabezas/packy-fable-ui/projects/rs-mca-proximity-prize-research/runs/2026-06-20T06-28-17-528Z-cycle65-thickened-gadget-color-occupancy-80b449fb`,
  preserve raw artifacts on completion, audit conservatively, then bank and
  continue with the next exact prompt.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 64 prefix-collision gadget return banked

- **Agent/model:** `claude-opus-4-8` via Packy/Fable `artifact_stream`,
  audited by Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle64_prefix_collision_gadget_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle64_prefix_collision_gadget_audit.md`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** BANKABLE_LEMMA / ROUTE_CUT / EXACT_NEW_WALL.
- **What is being added:** The Cycle 64 worker proves the exact
  prefix-collision gadget convolution for fixed subgroup scale, shows the
  Role 05 characteristic-17 packet is absorbed by seven gadget-class
  enumerators plus one marker, and cuts the hope that gadget charge gives
  scalar support-mass smallness.
- **How it is useful:** Closes the qualitative block-to-prefix-gadget
  bookkeeping layer while sharpening the live obstruction to thickened MCA
  color occupancy rather than scalar support mass.
- **What to do next:** Target
  `W-MODEL-GJ-THICKENED-GADGET-COLOR-OCCUPANCY` by computing or proving the
  Role 05 thickened color occupancy, and in parallel keep the finite frontier
  checker path `RS-PRIZE-FRONTIER-V1-REGISTRY-FIRST-RUN` alive.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 64 prefix-collision gadget prompt launched

- **Agent/model:** Codex launching `claude-opus-4-8` via Packy/Fable
  `artifact_stream`.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle64_prefix_collision_gadget_packet/`
  and `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROMPT PACKET / ACTIVE RUN.
- **What is being added:** A targeted Cycle 64 worker prompt for
  `L-MODEL-GJ-PREFIX-COLLISION-GADGET-PARTITION-AND-CHARGE`, the exact wall
  exposed by Cycle 63 Role 05's block-free near-split collision-mass
  counterpacket.
- **How it is useful:** Keeps the overnight loop focused on the live scalar
  apolar obstruction: either enlarge full-block trades to prefix-collision
  gadget charges that absorb the characteristic-17 packet, or produce a
  sharper route cut.
- **What to do next:** Monitor the active run
  `/Users/danielcabezas/packy-fable-ui/projects/rs-mca-proximity-prize-research/runs/2026-06-20T06-09-24-153Z-cycle64-prefix-collision-gadget-charge-78d0dd73`,
  preserve raw artifacts on completion, audit conservatively, then bank and
  continue with the next exact prompt.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 64 local prefix-gadget scout note

- **Agent/model:** Codex local bounded follow-up while Cycle 64 Fable run is
  active.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle64_local_prefix_gadget_scout.md`
  and `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / PLAN / LOCAL_REDUCTION.
- **What is being added:** A compact local reduction observing that the Role
  05 characteristic-17 packet is exactly the coefficient `[Y^4] W(Y)^7` for a
  48-state prefix-collision gadget class with
  `W(Y)=8(Y^1+Y^4+Y^7+Y^9+Y^12+Y^15)`.
- **How it is useful:** Separates the qualitative repair from the quantitative
  frontier issue: prefix-gadget charges can absorb the Role 05 packet
  structurally, but the total charge may still be too large.
- **What to do next:** If Cycle 64 returns only another wall, aim the next
  prompt at an implementation-ready
  `L-MODEL-GJ-PREFIX-GADGET-FRONTIER-CHARGE-CHECKER`.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 63 Round 2 returns banked and audited

- **Agent/model:** External 5.5/5.6 Pro theorem-worker returns, banked and
  audited by Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle63_round2_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle63_round2_audit.md`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / BANKABLE_LEMMA / COUNTERPACKET / ROUTE_CUT.
- **What is being added:** Raw Round 2 returns and a compact audit for the
  scalar-apolar block-trade repair route. Roles 02-04 bank corrected
  block-collapse, maximal `(K,D)` assignment, and dyadic overlap
  non-double-counting. Role 05 cuts the hoped block-free residual bound with a
  characteristic-17 near-split collision-mass packet. Role 08 cuts direct
  scalar-to-`t=1` MCA color transfer.
- **How it is useful:** Moves the live wall from "define canonical full-block
  trades" to the sharper
  `W-LIST-MODEL-GJ-NEAR-SPLIT-COLLISION-CLASS-MASS` /
  `L-MODEL-GJ-PREFIX-COLLISION-GADGET-PARTITION-AND-CHARGE` problem, with the
  finite frontier checker ready as a registry target.
- **What to do next:** Formalize and verify the Role 05 counterpacket, decide
  whether prefix-collision gadget charges absorb it or create an official-scale
  obstruction, and implement the first `RS-PRIZE-FRONTIER-V1` registry run.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 63 block-trade Round 2 packet

- **Agent/model:** Codex, following Cycle 62 Round 1 audit.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle63_block_trade_round2_packet/`
  and `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROMPT PACKET / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** A 9-worker prompt packet for the repaired
  scalar-list route after Role 04 cut the one-atom `Q_per` local-limit
  theorem. The packet centers on
  `L-MODEL-GJ-MAXIMAL-BLOCK-TRADE-CHARGE` and
  `W-LIST-MODEL-GJ-NEAR-SPLIT-COLLISION-CLASS-MASS`.
- **How it is useful:** Converts the Cycle 62 counterpacket into a focused
  block-trade repair round: formalize the counterpacket, prove block collapse,
  define canonical maximal `(K,D)` assignment, prove/kill overlap
  non-double-counting, and keep finite-checker / red-team / MCA-transfer
  lanes alive.
- **What to do next:** Upload
  `/Users/danielcabezas/20260620_cycle63_block_trade_round2_context.zip` to
  each worker, paste `COMMON_PROMPT.md`, then append one role prompt.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 62 Round 1 returns banked and audited

- **Agent/model:** External 5.5/5.6 Pro theorem-worker returns, banked and
  audited by Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle62_round1_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle62_round1_audit.md`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / BANKABLE_LEMMA / COUNTERPACKET / ROUTE_CUT /
  CONDITIONAL.
- **What is being added:** Raw Round 1 returns and verifier artifacts for the
  scalar-apolar execution packet. Roles 01 and 02 support the scalar apolar
  CI/GJ algebraic route; Role 04 cuts the declared one-atom `Q_per`
  local-limit route with an official-scale counterpacket; Role 05 repairs the
  `t=1` MCA color object by thickening the modulus; Roles 07 and 08 verify
  guard packets; Role 09 cuts right-factor-only two-block overlap rigidity.
- **How it is useful:** Moves the central scalar-list wall from
  `W-LIST-MODEL-GJ-QUOTIENT-CONDITIONED-LOCAL-LIMIT` to the sharper
  configuration/block-trade wall
  `L-MODEL-GJ-MAXIMAL-BLOCK-TRADE-CHARGE`.
- **What to do next:** Prepare a Round 2 packet around maximal `(K,D)`
  block-plus-defect assignment, finite overlap/non-double-counting, and the
  near-split collision-class-mass wall, while implementing the finite frontier
  checker and auditing the Role 01/02 algebra.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 62 scalar apolar Round 1 packet

- **Agent/model:** Codex, following the Cycle 61 Master Referee plan.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle62_scalar_apolar_round1_packet/`
  and `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROMPT PACKET / PLAN.
- **What is being added:** A 9-worker theorem prompt packet centered on the
  scalar-list apolar complete-intersection route, with `t=1` MCA
  generalized-Jacobian color as backup and finite checker / packet verifier
  lanes as guards.
- **How it is useful:** Converts the Master Referee decision into executable
  first-round prompts. The central wall is `L-LIST-MINIMAL-CI-GJ-FIBER`;
  nearby lanes prove the all-layer CI foundation, attack the model local
  limit, hunt counterpackets, and verify finite/frontier claims.
- **What to do next:** Upload
  `/Users/danielcabezas/20260620_cycle62_scalar_apolar_round1_context.zip`
  to each worker, paste `COMMON_PROMPT.md`, then append one role prompt.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 61 master referee plan banked locally

- **Agent/model:** 5.5 Pro Master Planner / Referee, banked by Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle61_master_referee_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle61_master_referee_audit.md`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / PLAN / CONDITIONAL.
- **What is being added:** The single master-referee answer that adjudicates
  the nine Cycle 61 planning responses. It selects the scalar-list apolar
  complete-intersection route as primary, with the `t=1` MCA
  generalized-Jacobian support-plus-color route as backup.
- **How it is useful:** Cuts the broad registry-first direction and turns the
  next proof round into a falsifiable route test around
  `L-LIST-MINIMAL-CI-GJ-FIBER`, the model generalized-Jacobian local limit,
  and a parallel finite frontier checker.
- **What to do next:** Prepare a targeted 9-instance round from the referee
  allocation, preserving the finite-checker and packet-verification lanes as
  route guards.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 61 planning synthesis and master referee packet

- **Agent/model:** Codex synthesizing nine external planning lanes.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle61_planning_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle61_planning_synthesis.md`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/cycle61_master_referee_packet/`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / PLAN / CONDITIONAL.
- **What is being added:** Raw preservation of the nine Cycle 61 planning
  answers, a consensus/conflict/actionability synthesis, and a
  master-referee prompt asking one final planning model to choose a primary
  route, cut distractions, and output a two-round execution plan.
- **How it is useful:** Converts the planning round into a decision problem:
  verify Lattes/split-rational registry first, prove support-overlap first,
  attack the `t=1` apolar/generalized-Jacobian base case, attack scalar
  list circuits, or build the finite checker first.
- **What to do next:** Send
  `/Users/danielcabezas/20260620_cycle61_master_referee_context.zip` plus
  `MASTER_REFEREE_PROMPT.md` to one strong 5.5 Pro master-referee instance,
  then bank its route decision before launching another proof round.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 61 planning packet

- **Agent/model:** Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/cycle61_planning_packet/`
  and `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / EXPERIMENTAL.
- **What is being added:** A planning-only prompt packet for strong
  theorem-worker instances, including common instructions, current route
  state, context read order, and nine role prompts covering executive route
  planning, MCA safe-side architecture, split-rational/Lattes registry,
  primitive JR occupancy, scalar list circuits, counterpacket kill tests,
  finite ledgers, formalization, and meta-referee review.
- **How it is useful:** Tests whether 5.5-style planning strength can improve
  the overall solve route after Cycle 60 expanded the quotient and primitive
  container ledgers. The packet asks for dependency DAGs, theorem packages,
  kill tests, and next-prompt allocation rather than another direct proof
  attempt.
- **What to do next:** Run the nine-role planning round with
  `/Users/danielcabezas/20260620_cycle61_planning_context.zip`, then bank the
  returned plans and synthesize a route-board update before launching another
  theorem-proving round.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 60 find-the-theorem audit

- **Agent/model:** Codex auditing nine external theorem-worker lanes.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle60_find_the_theorem_audit.md`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/cycle60_find_the_theorem_raw/`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / COUNTEREXAMPLE / CONDITIONAL / EXPERIMENTAL, with
  BANKABLE_LEMMA, ROUTE_CUT, and EXACT_NEW_WALL subresults.
- **What is being added:** Raw preservation and a compact audit of the Cycle
  60 responses. The round expands the quotient ledger to include genus-one
  Lattes/isogeny packets, cuts a point-fiber-only primitive JR route via
  divisor-norm/configuration characters, and banks support-counting reductions
  for QAR, hereditary MDS-3-core extraction, the `t=1` apolar normal form, and
  scalar full-support circuit transversals.
- **How it is useful:** Refines the M1/MCA and scalar-list safe-side walls from
  broad denominator classifiers into support-theoretic split-rational,
  Lattes, configuration-character, envelope, and primitive occupancy
  containers. It also identifies arithmetic verification tasks for the
  proposed Lattes finite packets before promotion.
- **What to do next:** Verify the Lattes degree-31 and degree-113 arithmetic,
  then attack `W-SRQ-GENUS-0/1-MONODROMY-CONTAINER`,
  `W-JR-CORANK-ONE-DIVISOR-NORM-CHARACTER-TRICHOTOMY`,
  `W-JR-T1-PRIMITIVE-APOLAR-SPLIT-NUMERATOR-INVERSE`, and
  `W-LIST-LOW-ARITY-SPLIT-DENOMINATOR-CIRCUIT-COVER`.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 59 5.5/5.6 route-repair audit

- **Agent/model:** Codex auditing nine external 5.5/5.6 theorem-worker lanes.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle59_5p6_route_repair_audit.md`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/cycle59_5p6_raw/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/cycle59_homerun_packet/`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/cycle60_find_the_theorem_packet/`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / EXPERIMENTAL, with COUNTERPACKET and BANKABLE_LEMMA
  subresults.
- **What is being added:** A conservative synthesis of the Cycle 59
  theorem-worker responses, raw response preservation with checksums, and a
  follow-up prompt packet targeting the corrected finite container theorem.
- **How it is useful:** Expands the quotient ledger from monomial
  `X -> X^M` action rank to projective/split-rational quotient action rank,
  banks the exact jet-residue bridge for `t < sigma`, cuts pure
  Kronecker-section extraction and high-denominator compression shortcuts, and
  sharpens the MCA wall to a finite canonical hereditary affine-secant
  container theorem.
- **What to do next:** Attack
  `W-MCA-PROJECTIVE-SPLIT-RATIONAL-ACTION-RANK-INVERSE`,
  `W-MCA-QAR-FIXED-DEFECT-COVER`, and the primitive finite affine-secant
  container bound, while keeping the scalar full-support list container as a
  parallel wall.

### 2026-06-20 - Cycle 58 5.5 Pro upper-wall audit

- **Agent/model:** Codex auditing nine external 5.5 Pro lanes.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/notes/m1/m1_cycle58_5p5_upper_audit.md`,
  `experimental/notes/m1/cycle58_5p5_raw/`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / EXPERIMENTAL, with COUNTEREXAMPLE subresults to
  overbroad upper targets.
- **What is being added:** A conservative synthesis of the nine Cycle 58
  theorem-worker responses, plus raw response preservation and checksums.
- **How it is useful:** Cuts the pure `n^{1+o(1)}` upper target, identifies the
  necessary occupancy/main term, confirms that literal quotient pullback is too
  narrow, and re-centers the MCA upper wall on a calibrated syndrome
  transverse-secant inverse theorem.
- **What to do next:** Attack
  `W-MCA-CALIBRATED-SYNDROME-TRANSVERSE-SECANT-INVERSE`, beginning with the
  quotient-free, envelope-free same-field bound with the Bessel occupancy term
  included.

### 2026-06-19 - Experimental folder streamlining

- **Agent/model:** Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/README.md`,
  `experimental/notes/README.md`, `experimental/scripts/README.md`,
  `experimental/data/README.md`, plus repository moves under
  `experimental/notes/`, `experimental/scripts/`, `experimental/data/`, and
  `experimental/lean/`.
- **Status:** AUDIT.
- **What is being added:** Reorganized the experimental workspace into four
  durable buckets: notes, scripts, compact data, and Lean. Removed generated
  Python caches and raw/prompt transcript dumps from dated AI-loop artifacts.
- **How it is useful:** Future agents now have a small root surface and a clear
  placement policy. Audited summaries and reproducible scripts remain, while
  bulky model-run provenance that was not needed for review is gone.
- **What to do next:** Keep new work inside the existing buckets, update
  `README.md` if a genuinely new bucket is needed, and avoid adding raw
  transcript archives unless they are the only reproducibility artifact.

### 2026-06-19 - PR #82/#84-#95 experimental integration

- **Agent/model:** AllenGrahamHart, scottdhughes, latifkasuli,
  DannyExperiments PRs, integrated by Codex.

  `experimental/notes/m1/m1_residue_line_roadmap.md`, M1 depth-two Kummer notes and
  verifiers, L1/L2 verifier scripts, and the selected
  `experimental/notes/f1/fable-loop/PRZ_REVIEW_INDEX.md` Cycle 49--57 audit
  layer.
- **Status:** PROVED / CONDITIONAL / CONJECTURAL / EXPERIMENTAL / AUDIT, as
  marked per file.
- **What is being added:** Manual integration of the useful recent PRs:
  PR #93 supersedes #85--#91 as the Scott L1 consolidation; PR #84 adds the
  L1 prefix/divisor/Fourier split; PR #92 adds L2 interleaved dilation and
  quotient-core constants; PR #94 adds a compact `F\B` deep-hole certificate
  packet; PR #82 adds the M1 low-slack Kummer/depth-two packet; PR #95 is
  integrated only as review index plus cycle audits, not as a raw 225k-line
  archive.
- **How it is useful:** Gives future work clear entry points: L1 quotient
  floors versus aperiodic Fourier cancellation, M1 two-coordinate/conductor
  targets, L2 aligned interleaved constants, an F1/Paper D explicit-line
  certificate target, and a compact Fable-loop upper-side route map.
- **What to do next:** Run and review the integrated verifiers, add a
  standalone verifier for the NFB JSON certificate, audit the M1 Kummer imports
  before consuming constants, and continue the Fable-loop program from the
  high-`j` constant-rate prompt rather than the cut `t=2,j=2` toy regime.

### 2026-06-18 - PR #79-#81 experimental integration

- **Agent/model:** AllenGrahamHart and scottdhughes PRs, integrated by Codex.

  `experimental/pr-triage-2026-06-18-round3.md`, and
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** CONDITIONAL / AUDIT / EXPERIMENTAL / COUNTEREXAMPLE.
- **What is being added:** Manual integration of PR #79's M1 depth-two
  Kummer-window material, PR #80's L1 arbitrary-fiber repair note, and PR
  #81's A0 external-import source check.  The M1 material is explicitly
  conditional on the isolated Kummer-Weil import; the L1 material repairs a
  false raw-support arbitrary-fiber route; the A0 material records source
  reachability without closing the Paper D import audit.
- **How it is useful:** Narrows three active ledgers without editing Papers
  A--D: M1 gains a sharper lift-window/saturation audit, L1 gets a corrected
  list-object target, and A0 has a reproducible source-access record for the
  universal-cap import chain.
- **What to do next:** Prove or cite the M1 `16p` Kummer estimate, decide
  whether Paper B should promote `ImgFib_U(s)` or another repaired L1 object,
  and obtain the CS25/ABF PDFs needed to close the remaining A0 checks.

### 2026-06-18 - Four-item packet label clarification

- **Agent/model:** Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/experiments.tex`,
  `experimental/experiments.pdf`, `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / CLARIFICATION.
- **What is being added:** Adds a self-contained explanation of what the
  AI-packet labels (a)--(d) mean: weak-slack positive regime, finite
  Fermat-prime packet, exponential-field construction, and imported BCHKS
  quotient-locator packet.
- **How it is useful:** Makes the experimental PDF readable without knowing
  the earlier discussion, and separates imported locator material from the
  independent local Paper B divisibility-gate theorem.
- **What to do next:** If the original four-item packet is archived in the
  repo, cross-link this clarification to the exact source file or PR.

### 2026-06-18 - Streamlined imported-locator ledger

- **Agent/model:** Human-provided streamlined note, logged by Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/experiments.tex`,
  `experimental/experiments.pdf`, `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / IMPORTED / WRAPPER / TARGET / NEW-LOCAL.
- **What is being added:** Replaces the narrower attribution note with a
  unified experimental ledger titled *Experimental Theorems and
  Imported-Locator Ledger for RS-MCA*.  The note explicitly imports the
  Ben-Sasson--Carmon--Habock--Kopparty--Saraf quotient-locator construction,
  gives the smooth-quotient notation dictionary, records the shared locator
  identity as imported rather than new, adds a list-fiber pigeonhole wrapper,
  states a slack-two/subfield target for the Paper D route, and preserves the
  Cycle 14--18 Paper B divisibility-gate theorem.
- **How it is useful:** Streamlines promotion decisions for Papers A--D:
  locator proofs from BCHKS must be cited at theorem and proof entry points;
  repository-side contributions are limited to dictionary/wrapper/ledger
  packaging unless separately proved; Paper D gets a precise augmented-code
  and subfield-pigeonhole target; Paper B keeps the independent restricted
  resonance gate as local experimental mathematics.
- **What to do next:** When editing the main papers, add the `BCHKS25`
  bibliography entry and cite Theorems 7.1 and 1.13 exactly where the locator
  construction is used.  Audit the augmented-code rung, slope field
  (`B` versus `F`), locator-codeword distinctness, and slack normalization
  before promoting any wrapper to a theorem.  Continue scanner work on the
  `G==0` divisibility-gate branch for the Paper B resonance window.

### 2026-06-18 - Proximity-gap attribution audit

- **Agent/model:** Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/experiments.tex`,
  `experimental/experiments.pdf`, `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / ATTRIBUTION.
- **What is being added:** Records that the AI-generated result (d) should be
  treated as an imported adaptation of Theorem 1.13 of
  Ben-Sasson--Carmon--Habock--Kopparty--Saraf, *On proximity gaps for
  Reed--Solomon codes*, rather than as a new repository contribution.  Also
  records the limitations of items (a)--(c): `1/sqrt(n)` slack, only three
  Fermat primes, and exponential field size.
- **How it is useful:** Gives Papers B/D/C a conservative integration plan:
  cite the external theorem, separate it from the Crites--Stewart import, and
  audit the consumed object before any MCA, line-decoding, or protocol ledger
  claim.
- **What to do next:** Add the bibliographic entry and exact theorem
  cross-reference when the main papers are edited, then verify whether item
  (d) converts to the RS-MCA object actually needed by Paper B.

### 2026-06-18 - PR #78 M1 residual-depth hierarchy

- **Agent/model:** AllenGrahamHart / Codex, integrated by Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/m1_support_coefficient_test.md`,
  `experimental/m1_support_occupancy_scan.py`,
  `experimental/m1_support_occupancy_scan.md`,
  `experimental/verify_m1_slack_two_depth_two_full_domain.py`,
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROVED / AUDIT / EXPERIMENTAL.
- **What is being added:** Integrated Allen's PR #78 M1 residual-depth
  hierarchy: the depth-two/next-slack transition theorem, terminal pure-zero
  residual-depth ledger, first-nonzero frontier partition, full-domain
  slack-two depth-two saturation verifier, and a high-index ceiling for the
  slack-two depth-two frontier.
- **How it is useful:** Separates inherited zero strata from genuinely new
  first-nonzero coefficient images in the M1 canonical-support scanner, giving
  sharper targets for Paper B's corrected MCA residue-line program.
- **What to do next:** Use the new verifier and scanner fields to attack
  proper-subgroup coset-image bounds, especially intermediate-index cases not
  decided by full-domain saturation or the coarse high-index ceiling.

### 2026-06-18 - Experimental theorem note

- **Agent/model:** Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/experiments.tex`,
  `experimental/experiments.pdf`, `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** PROVED / HEURISTIC / AUDIT.
- **What is being added:** A standalone LaTeX note collecting restricted
  Cycle 14--18 theorems and heuristics, including the Cycle 18
  divisibility-gate theorem with proof.
- **How it is useful:** Gives the experimental proof material a citable,
  compiled form without editing Papers A--D.
- **What to do next:** Extend the scanner to test the `G==0` gate and decide
  whether any source-valid growing-prime family has two-dimensional slope-map
  image.

### 2026-06-18 - Cycle 18 resonance slope-map reconstruction

- **Agent/model:** Codex.
- **Files added or changed:**
  `experimental/notes/f1/fable-loop/audits/20260618_CYCLE18_RESONANCE_SLOPE_MAP_COLLAPSE_AUDIT.md`,
  `experimental/scripts/fable_loop/local_checks/20260618_cycle18_resonance_slope_symbolic.py`,
  `experimental/notes/f1/fable-loop/README.md`,
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** BANKABLE_LEMMA / EXACT_NEW_WALL / AUDIT.
- **What is being added:** A local reconstruction of Danny's Cycle 18
  `t=2,j=3` resonance reduction: `Delta` becomes a monic quadratic in
  `tau3`, the alpha component is at most linear, and the non-coprime branch
  reduces to either `Delta1==0` or the graph `tau3=-h/s`. The audit also
  records the divisibility-gate theorem: if the cleared graph polynomial
  `G=s^2 Delta0(tau1,tau2,-h/s)` is nonzero, the branch is already
  curve-sized and contributes only `O(p)` slopes.
- **How it is useful:** Sharpens the Paper B/F1 restricted toy-window wall
  from the Cycle 16 `Q==0` split to a concrete rational slope-map collapse
  question.
- **What to do next:** Extend the Cycle 17 scanner to compute the graph branch
  and projective map image on source-valid split cubics across growing primes,
  with `G==0` as the first exact gate for possible `Theta(p^2)` behavior.

### 2026-06-18 - Paper B counterexample comparison

- **Agent/model:** Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/paper_b_counterexample_comparison.md`,
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / EXPERIMENTAL.
- **What is being added:** A theory-side comparison between recent
  experimental counterexamples and Paper B's locator-fiber, residue-line,
  extension-field, tangent-floor, and line-decoding statements.
- **How it is useful:** Identifies the raw arbitrary locator-fiber conjecture
  as needing repair, while separating route-cut counterexamples from genuine
  threats to the corrected MCA conjecture.
- **What to do next:** Review the proposed Paper B repairs, especially the
  replacement of raw `Fib_U` by a pruned/full-support arbitrary-word object.

### 2026-06-18 - Experimental summary

- **Agent/model:** Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** `experimental/SUMMARY.md`,
  `experimental/agents-log.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / EXPERIMENTAL.
- **What is being added:** A high-level summary of the recent PR wave and the
  current contents of `experimental/`, organized by how the material advances
  the corrected MCA program.
- **How it is useful:** Gives new agents and human reviewers a map of which
  experimental notes support L1, M1, M2, F1, L2, A0/A1, protocol ledgers, and
  formalization, while keeping proof status conservative.
- **What to do next:** Use the summary as an orientation map, then verify
  individual claims from their source notes and scripts before promotion.

### 2026-06-18 - New PR triage integration

- **Agent/model:** Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** Integrated experimental material from PRs #67,

  superseded by #77; added `experimental/pr-triage-2026-06-18.md`.
- **Status:** AUDIT / EXPERIMENTAL.
- **What is being added:** Second open-PR triage pass covering M1, F1, L2,
  M2, L1, A1, Fable-loop, and locator-fiber cross-check contributions.
- **How it is useful:** Banks useful experimental notes, verifiers, scanners,
  and audit provenance while preserving the rule that main papers remain
  unchanged and new material stays in `experimental/`.
- **What to do next:** Run full verifier coverage, review mathematical claims
  before promotion, and close the source PRs as manually integrated or
  superseded once this commit is pushed.

### 2026-06-17 - Open PR triage integration

- **Agent/model:** Codex.
- **Files added or changed:** Integrated experimental material from PRs #1,
  #2, #3, and #46 through #66; added
  `experimental/pr-triage-2026-06-17.md`; renamed PR #55's dither scanner to
  `experimental/quotient_profile_dither.py` with matching `.md` note.
- **Status:** AUDIT / EXPERIMENTAL.
- **What is being added:** One-by-one triage of the open PR queue and local
  integration of accepted experimental notes, scanners, certificates, and
  audit bundles.
- **How it is useful:** Preserves useful agent contributions while enforcing
  the repository rule that new material starts in `experimental/` and Papers
  A-D remain unchanged.
- **What to do next:** Run verifiers and audits on the integrated material,
  review mathematical notes before promotion, and close the original PRs as
  manually integrated once the integration commit is pushed.
